### [1326. Minimum Number of Taps to Open to Water a Garden](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-taps-to-open-to-water-a-garden/)

There is a one-dimensional garden on the x-axis. The garden starts at the point `0` and ends at the point `n`. (i.e., the length of the garden is `n`).

There are `n + 1` taps located at points `[0, 1, ..., n]` in the garden.

Given an integer `n` and an integer array `ranges` of length `n + 1` where `ranges[i]` (0-indexed) means the `i-th` tap can water the area `[i - ranges[i], i + ranges[i]]` if it was open.

Return *the minimum number of taps* that should be open to water the whole garden, If the garden cannot be watered return **-1**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 5, ranges = [3,4,1,1,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: The tap at point 0 can cover the interval [-3,3]
The tap at point 1 can cover the interval [-3,5]
The tap at point 2 can cover the interval [1,3]
The tap at point 3 can cover the interval [2,4]
The tap at point 4 can cover the interval [4,4]
The tap at point 5 can cover the interval [5,5]
Opening Only the second tap will water the whole garden [0,5]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 3, ranges = [0,0,0,0]
Output: -1
Explanation: Even if you activate all the four taps you cannot water the whole garden.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 104`
- `ranges.length == n + 1`
- `0 <= ranges[i] <= 100`

区间合并最小值问题，先排序，然后贪心。

#### 代码

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minTaps(int n, vector<int>& ranges) {
        vector<vector<int>> taps;
        for (int i = 0 ; i < ranges.size(); i++) {
            taps.push_back({i- ranges[i], i + ranges[i]});
        }
        sort(taps.begin(), taps.end());
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0, st = 0, end = 0; st < n; count++, st = end) {
            for (; i < taps.size() && taps[i][0] <= st; i++) {
                end = max(end, taps[i][1]);
            }
            if (end == st) return -1;
        }
        return count;
    }
};


```

### [378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-sorted-matrix/)

Given an `n x n` `matrix` where each of the rows and columns is sorted in ascending order, return *the* `kth` *smallest element in the matrix*.

Note that it is the `kth` smallest element **in the sorted order**, not the `kth` **distinct** element.

You must find a solution with a memory complexity better than `O(n2)`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix = [[1,5,9],[10,11,13],[12,13,15]], k = 8
Output: 13
Explanation: The elements in the matrix are [1,5,9,10,11,12,13,13,15], and the 8th smallest number is 13
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: matrix = [[-5]], k = 1
Output: -5
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 300`
- `-109 <= matrix[i][j] <= 109`
- All the rows and columns of `matrix` are **guaranteed** to be sorted in **non-decreasing order**.
- `1 <= k <= n2`

 

**Follow up:**

- Could you solve the problem with a constant memory (i.e., `O(1)` memory complexity)?
- Could you solve the problem in `O(n)` time complexity? The solution may be too advanced for an interview but you may find reading [this paper](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~andy/pubs/X+Y.pdf) fun.

#### Solution

Solution 1:**Max Heap keeps up to k elements**

Time: `O(M * N * logK)`

Space complexity: O(k)

**Solution 2: Min Heap to find kth smallest element from amongst N sorted list**

- Since each of the rows in matrix are already sorted, we can understand the problem as finding the **kth smallest element** from amongst `M` sorted rows.
- We start the pointers to point to the beginning of each rows, then we iterate `k` times, for each time `ith`, the top of the `minHeap` is the `ith` smallest element in the matrix. We pop the `top` from the `minHeap` then add the next element which has the same row with that `top` to the `minHeap`.

Complexity:

- Time: `O(K * logK)`
- Space: `O(K)`

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int kthSmallest(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int k) {
        priority_queue<int> q;
        for (int i = 0; i < matrix.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < matrix[0].size(); j++) {
                q.push(matrix[i][j]);
                if (q.size() > k) {
                    q.pop();
                }
            }
        }
        return q.top();
    }
};
```

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int kthSmallest(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int k) {
        priority_queue<vector<int>, vector<vector<int>>, greater<vector<int>>> q;
        for (int i = 0; i < min((int)matrix.size(), k); i++) {
            q.push({matrix[i][0], i, 0});
        }
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            auto cur = q.top(); q.pop();
            ans = cur[0];
            int row = cur[1], col = cur[2];
            int next_c = col + 1;
            if (next_c < matrix[0].size()) {
                q.push({matrix[row][next_c], row, next_c});
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

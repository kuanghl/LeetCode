### 332. Reconstruct Itinerary

You are given a list of airline `tickets` where `tickets[i] = [fromi, toi]` represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it.

All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from `"JFK"`, thus, the itinerary must begin with `"JFK"`. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.

- For example, the itinerary `["JFK", "LGA"]` has a smaller lexical order than `["JFK", "LGB"]`.

You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all the tickets once and only once.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: tickets = [["MUC","LHR"],["JFK","MUC"],["SFO","SJC"],["LHR","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","MUC","LHR","SFO","SJC"]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/itinerary2-graph.jpg)

```
Input: tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"] but it is larger in lexical order.
```

**Constraints:**

- ``1 <= tickets.length <= 300`
- `tickets[i].length == 2`
- `fromi.length == 3`
- `toi.length == 3`
- `fromi` and `toi` consist of uppercase English letters.
- `fromi != toi`

#### Solution

First making tickets->graph, and then using DFS. But sometimes there are some duplicate tickets, like [["JFK", "SFO"], ["JFK", "SFO"]], so we need record the number of duplicate tickets. And also, we need use all the tickets once and only once.

#### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    bool DFS(unordered_map<string, map<string, int>>& tables, const string& cur, 
            int total, vector<string>& res) {
        if (total == 0) return true;
        for (auto& item : tables[cur]) {
            if (item.second == 0) continue;
            res.push_back(item.first);
            item.second--;
            if (DFS(tables, item.first, total - 1, res)) return true;
            item.second++;
            res.pop_back();
        }
        return false;
    }
public:
    vector<string> findItinerary(vector<vector<string>>& tickets) {
        // we need record the number of duplicate tickets, so is int not bool
        unordered_map<string, map<string, int>> tables;
        // we need use all the tickets once and only once
        int total = tickets.size();
        for (auto& t : tickets){
            tables[t[0]][t[1]] += 1;
        }
        string cur = "JFK";
        vector<string> res = {cur};
        DFS(tables, cur, total, res);
        return res;
    }
};
```

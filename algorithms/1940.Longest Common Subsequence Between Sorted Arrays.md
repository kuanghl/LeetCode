### [1940. Longest Common Subsequence Between Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence-between-sorted-arrays/)

Given an array of integer arrays `arrays` where each `arrays[i]` is sorted in **strictly increasing** order, return *an integer array representing the **longest common subsequence** between **all** the arrays*.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arrays = [[1,3,4],
                 [1,4,7,9]]
Output: [1,4]
Explanation: The longest common subsequence in the two arrays is [1,4].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arrays = [[2,3,6,8],
                 [1,2,3,5,6,7,10],
                 [2,3,4,6,9]]
Output: [2,3,6]
Explanation: The longest common subsequence in all three arrays is [2,3,6].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arrays = [[1,2,3,4,5],
                 [6,7,8]]
Output: []
Explanation: There is no common subsequence between the two arrays.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= arrays.length <= 100`
- `1 <= arrays[i].length <= 100`
- `1 <= arrays[i][j] <= 100`
- `arrays[i]` is sorted in **strictly increasing** order.

#### Solution

// similar with 23. Merge k Sorted Lists

// Time Complexity: O(n^2)

// Space Complexity: O(n)

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> longestCommonSubsequence(vector<vector<int>>& arrays) {
        vector<int> res = arrays[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < arrays.size(); i++) {
            auto& cur = arrays[i];
            int l = 0, r = 0;
            vector<int> tmp;
            while (l < res.size() && r < cur.size()) {
                if (res[l] == cur[r]) {
                    tmp.push_back(res[l]);
                    l++;
                    r++;
                }
                else if (res[l] < cur[r]) {
                    l++;
                }
                else {
                    r++;
                }
            }
            res.swap(tmp);
        }
        return res;
    }
};

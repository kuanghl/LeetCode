### [2158. Amount of New Area Painted Each Day](https://leetcode.com/problems/amount-of-new-area-painted-each-day/)

There is a long and thin painting that can be represented by a number line. You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `paint` of length `n`, where `paint[i] = [starti, endi]`. This means that on the `ith` day you need to paint the area **between** `starti` and `endi`.

Painting the same area multiple times will create an uneven painting so you only want to paint each area of the painting at most **once**.

Return *an integer array* `worklog` *of length* `n`*, where* `worklog[i]` *is the amount of **new** area that you painted on the* `ith` *day.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: paint = [[1,4],[4,7],[5,8]]
Output: [3,3,1]
Explanation:
On day 0, paint everything between 1 and 4.
The amount of new area painted on day 0 is 4 - 1 = 3.
On day 1, paint everything between 4 and 7.
The amount of new area painted on day 1 is 7 - 4 = 3.
On day 2, paint everything between 7 and 8.
Everything between 5 and 7 was already painted on day 1.
The amount of new area painted on day 2 is 8 - 7 = 1. 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: paint = [[1,4],[5,8],[4,7]]
Output: [3,3,1]
Explanation:
On day 0, paint everything between 1 and 4.
The amount of new area painted on day 0 is 4 - 1 = 3.
On day 1, paint everything between 5 and 8.
The amount of new area painted on day 1 is 8 - 5 = 3.
On day 2, paint everything between 4 and 5.
Everything between 5 and 7 was already painted on day 1.
The amount of new area painted on day 2 is 5 - 4 = 1. 
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/02/01/screenshot-2022-02-01-at-17-19-49-diagram-drawio-diagrams-net.png)

```
Input: paint = [[1,5],[2,4]]
Output: [4,0]
Explanation:
On day 0, paint everything between 1 and 5.
The amount of new area painted on day 0 is 5 - 1 = 4.
On day 1, paint nothing because everything between 2 and 4 was already painted on day 0.
The amount of new area painted on day 1 is 0.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= paint.length <= 105`
- `paint[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 104`

#### 解析

1. Merge Intervals

For each day, we first search for the existing painted interval on the left. If that interval exists and overlaps, we extend it. Otherwise, we create a new interval.

Then, we go right and merge all overlapping intervals into the current (cur) one. All this time, we carefully track the newly painted area.

2. Segment tree

#### 代码

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> amountPainted(vector<vector<int>>& paint) {
        map<int, int> m;
        vector<int> res;
        for (auto& p : paint) {
            int l = p[0], r = p[1];
            auto next = m.upper_bound(l), cur = next;
            // extend left
            if (cur != m.begin() && prev(cur)->second >= l) {
                cur = prev(cur);
                l = cur->second;
            }
            // new insert
            else {
                cur = m.insert({l, r}).first;
            }
            int pt = r-l;
            while (next != m.end() && next->first < r) {
                pt -= min(next->second, r) - next->first;
                r = max(next->second, r);
                m.erase(next++);
            }
            cur->second = max(r, cur->second);
            res.push_back(max(0, pt));
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

segment tree:

```c++
struct SegTree {
    vector<int> tree;
    vector<int> adds;
    SegTree(int n) {
        tree.resize(4*n, 0);
        adds.resize(4*n, 0);
    }
    void pushDown(int idx, int left_num, int right_num) {
        if (adds[idx] == 0) return;
        tree[idx*2+1] = adds[idx]*left_num;
        tree[idx*2+2] = adds[idx]*right_num;
        adds[idx*2+1] = adds[idx];
        adds[idx*2+2] = adds[idx];  
        adds[idx] = 0;
    }
    void update(int idx, int start, int end, int l, int r, int val) {
        if (l <= start && end <= r) {
            tree[idx] = (end - start + 1) * val;
            adds[idx] = val;
            return;
        }
        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
        pushDown(idx, mid - start + 1, end-mid);
        if (l <= mid) update(idx*2+1, start, mid, l, r, val);
        if (r > mid) update(idx*2+2, mid+1, end, l, r, val);
        tree[idx] = tree[idx*2+1] + tree[idx*2+2];
    }

    int query(int idx, int start, int end, int l, int r) {
        if (l <= start && end <= r) {
            return tree[idx];
        }
        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
        int res = 0;
        pushDown(idx, mid - start + 1, end-mid);
        if (l <= mid) res += query(idx*2+1, start, mid, l, r);
        if (r > mid) res += query(idx*2+2, mid+1, end, l, r);
        return res;
    }
};
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> amountPainted(vector<vector<int>>& paint) {
        int len = 1e5;
        SegTree root(len);
        vector<int> res;
        for (auto& p : paint) {
            int num = root.query(0, 0, len, min(p[0]+1, p[1]), p[1]);
            res.push_back(max(p[1]-p[0]-num, 0));
            root.update(0, 0, len, p[0]+1, p[1], 1);
        }
        return res;
    }
};

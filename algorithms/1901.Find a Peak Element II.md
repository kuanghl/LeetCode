### [1901. Find a Peak Element II](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-a-peak-element-ii/)

A **peak** element in a 2D grid is an element that is **strictly greater** than all of its **adjacent** neighbors to the left, right, top, and bottom.

Given a **0-indexed** `m x n` matrix `mat` where **no two adjacent cells are equal**, find **any** peak element `mat[i][j]` and return *the length 2 array* `[i,j]`.

You may assume that the entire matrix is surrounded by an **outer perimeter** with the value `-1` in each cell.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(m log(n))` or `O(n log(m))` time.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/08/1.png)

```
Input: mat = [[1,4],[3,2]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Both 3 and 4 are peak elements so [1,0] and [0,1] are both acceptable answers.
```

**Example 2:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/07/3.png)**

```
Input: mat = [[10,20,15],[21,30,14],[7,16,32]]
Output: [1,1]
Explanation: Both 30 and 32 are peak elements so [1,1] and [2,2] are both acceptable answers.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == mat.length`
- `n == mat[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 500`
- `1 <= mat[i][j] <= 105`
- No two adjacent cells are equal.

#### Solution

2D of https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/description/

binary search to find a col, and judge which row of the col is biggest

then judge if `mat[row][col] `is Peak

if not, change low/high to corresponding col

Time complexity: mlog(n)

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findPeakGrid(vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
        int m = mat.size(), n = mat[0].size();
        int low = 0, high = n-1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low+high)/2;
            int max_row = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
                max_row = mat[i][mid] > mat[max_row][mid] ? i : max_row;
            }
            bool left = (mid == 0)||(mat[max_row][mid] > mat[max_row][mid-1]);
            bool right = (mid == n-1) || (mat[max_row][mid] > mat[max_row][mid+1]);
            if (left && right) return {max_row, mid};
            if (!left) {
                high = mid-1;
            }
            else {
                low = mid+1;
            }
        }
        return {};
    }
};
```

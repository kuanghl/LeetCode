### [159. Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-two-distinct-characters/)

Given a string `s`, return *the length of the longest* 

*substring*

 *that contains at most **two distinct characters***.



 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "eceba"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substring is "ece" which its length is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "ccaabbb"
Output: 5
Explanation: The substring is "aabbb" which its length is 5.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s` consists of English letters.

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(string s) {
        vector<int> ch(128, 0);
        int cnt = 0;
        int begin = 0;
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            if (++ch[s[i]] == 1) {
                while (cnt == 2) {
                    if (--ch[s[begin]] == 0) {
                        cnt--;
                    }
                    begin++;
                }
                cnt++;
            }
            res = max(res, i - begin+1);
        }
        return res;
    }
};

### [305. Number of Islands II](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands-ii/)

You are given an empty 2D binary grid `grid` of size `m x n`. The grid represents a map where `0`'s represent water and `1`'s represent land. Initially, all the cells of `grid` are water cells (i.e., all the cells are `0`'s).

We may perform an add land operation which turns the water at position into a land. You are given an array `positions` where `positions[i] = [ri, ci]` is the position `(ri, ci)` at which we should operate the `ith` operation.

Return *an array of integers* `answer` *where* `answer[i]` *is the number of islands after turning the cell* `(ri, ci)` *into a land*.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: m = 3, n = 3, positions = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,2],[2,1]]
Output: [1,1,2,3]
Explanation:
Initially, the 2d grid is filled with water.
- Operation #1: addLand(0, 0) turns the water at grid[0][0] into a land. We have 1 island.
- Operation #2: addLand(0, 1) turns the water at grid[0][1] into a land. We still have 1 island.
- Operation #3: addLand(1, 2) turns the water at grid[1][2] into a land. We have 2 islands.
- Operation #4: addLand(2, 1) turns the water at grid[2][1] into a land. We have 3 islands.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: m = 1, n = 1, positions = [[0,0]]
Output: [1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= m, n, positions.length <= 104`
- `1 <= m * n <= 104`
- `positions[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ri < m`
- `0 <= ci < n`

 

**Follow up:** Could you solve it in time complexity `O(k log(mn))`, where `k == positions.length`?

#### Solution

union find

#### Code

```cpp
class UnionFind {
private:
    int c;
    vector<int> parent;
public:
    UnionFind(int n) {
        c = 0;
        parent.resize(n, -1);
    }
    void add(int x) {
        parent[x] = x;
        c++;
    }
    int find(int x) {
        while (x != parent[x]) {
            parent[x] = parent[parent[x]];
            x = parent[x];
        }
        return x;
    }
    void do_union(int x, int y) {
        int rootx = find(x);
        int rooty = find(y);
        if (rootx == rooty) return;
        parent[rootx] = rooty;
        c--;
    }
    bool connected(int x, int y) {
        return find(x) == find(y);
    }
    int count() {
        return c;
    }
};

                continue;
            }

            for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
                int next_r = p[0] + next[i];
                int next_c = p[1] + next[i+1];
                if (s.find({next_r, next_c}) != s.end()) {
                    uf.do_union(p[0] * n + p[1], next_r*n + next_c);
                }
            }
            res.push_back(uf.count());

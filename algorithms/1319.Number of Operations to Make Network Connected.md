### [1319. Number of Operations to Make Network Connected](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-operations-to-make-network-connected/)

There are `n` computers numbered from `0` to `n - 1` connected by ethernet cables `connections` forming a network where `connections[i] = [ai, bi]` represents a connection between computers `ai` and `bi`. Any computer can reach any other computer directly or indirectly through the network.

You are given an initial computer network `connections`. You can extract certain cables between two directly connected computers, and place them between any pair of disconnected computers to make them directly connected.

Return *the minimum number of times you need to do this in order to make all the computers connected*. If it is not possible, return `-1`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Remove cable between computer 1 and 2 and place between computers 1 and 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/02/sample_2_1677.png)

```
Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: 2
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2]]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are not enough cables.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `1 <= connections.length <= min(n * (n - 1) / 2, 105)`
- `connections[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi < n`
- `ai != bi`
- There are no repeated connections.
- No two computers are connected by more than one cable.

#### Solution

union find

#### Code

```c++
struct UnionFind{
    int count;
    vector<int> parent;
    UnionFind(int c) {
        count = c;
        parent.assign(c, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < c; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
        }
    }
    int find(int i) {
        return parent[i] == i ? i : parent[i] = find(parent[i]);
    }
    void myunion(int a, int b) {
        int pa = find(a), pb = find(b);
        if (pa == pb) return;
        parent[pa] = pb;
        count--;
    }
    int Count() {
        return count;
    }

};
class Solution {
public:
    int makeConnected(int n, vector<vector<int>>& connections) {
        if (n-1 > connections.size()) return -1;
        UnionFind uf(n);
        for (auto& c : connections) {
            uf.myunion(c[0], c[1]);
        }
        return uf.Count()-1;
    }
};
```

### [1631. Path With Minimum Effort](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-to-connect-all-points/)

You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are given `heights`, a 2D array of size `rows x columns`, where `heights[row][col]` represents the height of cell `(row, col)`. You are situated in the top-left cell, `(0, 0)`, and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, `(rows-1, columns-1)` (i.e., **0-indexed**). You can move **up**, **down**, **left**, or **right**, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum **effort**.

A route's **effort** is the **maximum absolute difference** in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.

Return *the minimum **effort** required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: heights = [[1,2,2],[3,8,2],[5,3,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The route of [1,3,5,3,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 2 in consecutive cells.
This is better than the route of [1,2,2,2,5], where the maximum absolute difference is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/04/ex2.png)

```
Input: heights = [[1,2,3],[3,8,4],[5,3,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The route of [1,2,3,4,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 1 in consecutive cells, which is better than route [1,3,5,3,5].
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/04/ex3.png)

```
Input: heights = [[1,2,1,1,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,1,1,2,1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: This route does not require any effort.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `rows == heights.length`
- `columns == heights[i].length`
- `1 <= rows, columns <= 100`
- `1 <= heights[i][j] <= 106`

#### Solution

最大化最小值/最小化最大值，一般用二分解决。

binary search+DFS

every time we noly need find one path to satify the aim. So the time complexity is (n\*m\*log(MAX_HEIGHT))

#### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    vector<int> next = {0, -1, 0, 1, 0};
    bool DFS(vector<vector<int>>& heights, vector<vector<bool>>& visited, 
        int row, int col, int effort, int aim) {
            int n = heights.size();
            int m = heights[0].size();
            if (row == n-1 && col == m-1) {
                return true;
            }
            visited[row][col] = true;
            for (int i = 0; i < next.size() - 1; i++) {
                int nextR = row + next[i];
                int nextC = col + next[i+1];
              // every time we noly need find one path to satify the aim.
                if (nextR >= 0 && nextR < n && nextC >= 0 && 
                    nextC < m && !visited[nextR][nextC]) {
                    int tmp = max(effort, abs(heights[nextR][nextC] - heights[row][col]));
                    if (tmp <= aim && DFS(heights, visited, nextR, nextC, tmp, aim)) return true;
                }
            }
            return false;
        }
public:
    int minimumEffortPath(vector<vector<int>>& heights) {
        int n = heights.size();
        int m = heights[0].size();
        int maxValue = 0, minValue = INT_MAX;
        for(auto& items : heights) {
            for (auto& i : items) {
                maxValue = max(maxValue, i);
                minValue = min(minValue, i);
            }
        }
        int right = maxValue - minValue;
        int left = 0;
        while (left < right) {
            vector<vector<bool>> visited(heights.size(), 
            vector<bool>(heights[0].size(), false));
            int mid = left + (right-left) / 2;
            if (DFS(heights, visited, 0, 0, 0, mid)) {
                right = mid;
            }
            else {
                left = mid+1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
};

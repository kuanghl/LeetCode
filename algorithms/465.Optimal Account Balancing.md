### [465. Optimal Account Balancing](https://leetcode.com/problems/optimal-account-balancing/)

You are given an array of transactions `transactions` where `transactions[i] = [fromi, toi, amounti]` indicates that the person with `ID = fromi` gave `amounti $` to the person with `ID = toi`.

Return *the minimum number of transactions required to settle the debt*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: transactions = [[0,1,10],[2,0,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
Person #2 gave person #0 $5.
Two transactions are needed. One way to settle the debt is person #1 pays person #0 and #2 $5 each.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: transactions = [[0,1,10],[1,0,1],[1,2,5],[2,0,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
Person #1 gave person #0 $1.
Person #1 gave person #2 $5.
Person #2 gave person #0 $5.
Therefore, person #1 only need to give person #0 $4, and all debt is settled.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= transactions.length <= 8`
- `transactions[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= fromi, toi < 12`
- `fromi != toi`
- `1 <= amounti <= 100`

#### Solution

DFS

for one trans, find another has opposite sign, and clear cur trans

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int DFS(vector<int>& trans, int cur) {
        while (cur < trans.size() && trans[cur] == 0) cur++;
        int res = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = cur+1, prev = 0; i < trans.size(); i++) {
            if (trans[i] != prev && trans[i]*trans[cur] < 0) {
                // clear cur
                prev = trans[i];
                trans[i] += trans[cur];
                res = min(res, 1 + DFS(trans, cur+1));
                trans[i] -= trans[cur];
            }
        }
        return res == INT_MAX ? 0 : res;
    }
    int minTransfers(vector<vector<int>>& transactions) {
        unordered_map<int, int> m;
        for (auto& trans : transactions) {
            m[trans[0]]-=trans[2];
            m[trans[1]]+=trans[2];
        }
        vector<int> trans;
        for (auto& item:m) {
            if (item.second != 0) {
                trans.push_back(item.second);
            }
        }
        for (auto& i : trans) cout<< i<< " ";
        cout<<endl;

        
        return DFS(trans, 0);
    }
};
```

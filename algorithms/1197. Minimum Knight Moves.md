### [1197. Minimum Knight Moves](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-knight-moves/)

In an **infinite** chess board with coordinates from `-infinity` to `+infinity`, you have a **knight** at square `[0, 0]`.

A knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal direction.

Return *the minimum number of steps needed to move the knight to the square* `[x, y]`. It is guaranteed the answer exists.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: x = 2, y = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: [0, 0] → [2, 1]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: x = 5, y = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: [0, 0] → [2, 1] → [4, 2] → [3, 4] → [5, 5]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `-300 <= x, y <= 300`
- `0 <= |x| + |y| <= 300`

#### Solution

BFS, but as symmetry, we can make x, y to first Quadrant only, and next x and next y must be >= -1, (because connot reach from (0, 0) to (1, 1) if only allow >= 0)

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> next={{-1, -2}, {-2, -1}, {-2, 1}, {-1, 2}, {1, -2}, {2, -1}, {2, 1}, {1, 2}};
    int minKnightMoves(int x, int y) {
        x = abs(x);
        y = abs(y);
        set<pair<int, int>> visited;
        queue<pair<int, int>> q;
        q.push({0, 0});
        int res = 0;
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                auto [cx, cy] = q.front(); q.pop();
                if (cx == x && cy == y) {
                    return res;
                }
                for (auto& nx : next) {
                    int n_x = nx[0] + cx;
                    int n_y = nx[1] + cy;
                    if (n_x >= -1 && n_y >= -1 && visited.insert({n_x, n_y}).second) {
                        q.push({n_x, n_y});
                    }
                }
            } 
            res++;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```

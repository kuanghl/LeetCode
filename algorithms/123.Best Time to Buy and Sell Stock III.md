### 123.Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most *two* transactions.

**Note: **You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

#### 解析

`dp[i][0]`第一次中持有股票的最大利润

`dp[i][1]`第一次中未持有股票的最大利润（已卖出）

`dp[i][2]`第二次中持有股票的最大利润

`dp[i][3]`第二次中没持有股票的最大利润

`dp[0][2]`和`dp[0][0]`初始化成`-prices[0]`

#### 代码

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int n = prices.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(4, 0));
        dp[0][0] = -prices[0];
        dp[0][2] = -prices[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][0], -prices[i]);
            dp[i][1] = max(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][0] + prices[i]);
            dp[i][2] = max(dp[i-1][2], dp[i-1][1] - prices[i]);
            dp[i][3] = max(dp[i-1][3], dp[i-1][2] + prices[i]);
        }
        return dp[n-1][3];
    }
};
```

### [1359. Count All Valid Pickup and Delivery Options](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-all-valid-pickup-and-delivery-options/)

- Given `n` orders, each order consist in pickup and delivery services. 

  Count all valid pickup/delivery possible sequences such that delivery(i) is always after of pickup(i). 

  Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

   

  **Example 1:**

  ```
  Input: n = 1
  Output: 1
  Explanation: Unique order (P1, D1), Delivery 1 always is after of Pickup 1.
  ```

  **Example 2:**

  ```
  Input: n = 2
  Output: 6
  Explanation: All possible orders: 
  (P1,P2,D1,D2), (P1,P2,D2,D1), (P1,D1,P2,D2), (P2,P1,D1,D2), (P2,P1,D2,D1) and (P2,D2,P1,D1).
  This is an invalid order (P1,D2,P2,D1) because Pickup 2 is after of Delivery 2.
  ```

  **Example 3:**

  ```
  Input: n = 3
  Output: 90
  ```

   

  **Constraints:**

  - `1 <= n <= 500`

#### Solution

Intuition 1

Assume we have already `n - 1` pairs, now we need to insert the `n`th pair.
To insert the first element, there are `n * 2 - 1` chioces of position。
To insert the second element, there are `n * 2` chioces of position。
So there are `(n * 2 - 1) * n * 2` permutations.
Considering that delivery(i) is always after of pickup(i), we need to divide 2.
So it's `(n * 2 - 1) * n`.

Intuition 2

We consider the first element in all 2n elements.
The first must be a pickup, and we have n pickups as chioce.
Its pair can be any position in the rest of `n*2-1` positions.
So it's `(n * 2 - 1) * n`.

Intuition 3

The total number of all permutation obviously eauqls to 2n!.
For each pair, the order is determined, so we need to divide by 2.
So the final result is `(2n)!/(2^n)`

Complexity

For each run, Time `O(N)`, Space `O(1)`.
Also we can cache the result, so that O(1) amortized for each `n`.
But in doesn't help in case of LC.
Also we can pre calculate all results, so that we have `O(N)` space and `O(1)` time.

#### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countOrders(int n) {
        long res = 1, mod = 1e9+7;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            res = res * (2*i-1)*i % mod;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

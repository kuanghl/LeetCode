### [1428. Leftmost Column with at Least a One](https://leetcode.com/problems/leftmost-column-with-at-least-a-one/)

A **row-sorted binary matrix** means that all elements are `0` or `1` and each row of the matrix is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Given a **row-sorted binary matrix** `binaryMatrix`, return *the index (0-indexed) of the **leftmost column** with a 1 in it*. If such an index does not exist, return `-1`.

**You can't access the Binary Matrix directly.** You may only access the matrix using a `BinaryMatrix` interface:

- `BinaryMatrix.get(row, col)` returns the element of the matrix at index `(row, col)` (0-indexed).
- `BinaryMatrix.dimensions()` returns the dimensions of the matrix as a list of 2 elements `[rows, cols]`, which means the matrix is `rows x cols`.

Submissions making more than `1000` calls to `BinaryMatrix.get` will be judged *Wrong Answer*. Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.

For custom testing purposes, the input will be the entire binary matrix `mat`. You will not have access to the binary matrix directly.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: mat = [[0,0],[1,1]]
Output: 0
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/10/25/untitled-diagram-4.jpg)

```
Input: mat = [[0,0],[0,1]]
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/10/25/untitled-diagram-3.jpg)

```
Input: mat = [[0,0],[0,0]]
Output: -1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `rows == mat.length`
- `cols == mat[i].length`
- `1 <= rows, cols <= 100`
- `mat[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
- `mat[i]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

#### Solution

binary search for every row

Time: O(n*logn)

#### Code

```c++
/**
 * // This is the BinaryMatrix's API interface.
 * // You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation
 * class BinaryMatrix {
 *   public:
 *     int get(int row, int col);
 *     vector<int> dimensions();
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int leftMostColumnWithOne(BinaryMatrix &binaryMatrix) {
        auto shape = binaryMatrix.dimensions();
        int rows = shape[0], cols = shape[1];
        int res = cols;
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            int left = 0, right = cols-1;
            while (left < right) {
                int mid = (left + right) / 2;
                if (binaryMatrix.get(i, mid) == 1) {
                    right = mid;
                }
                else {
                    left = mid+1;
                }
            }
            if (binaryMatrix.get(i, left) == 1)
                res = min(res, left);
        }
        return res == cols ? -1 : res;
    }
};
```

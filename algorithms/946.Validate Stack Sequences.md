### [946. Validate Stack Sequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-stack-sequences/)

Given two integer arrays `pushed` and `popped` each with distinct values, return `true` *if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack, or* `false` *otherwise.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,5,3,2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: We might do the following sequence:
push(1), push(2), push(3), push(4),
pop() -> 4,
push(5),
pop() -> 5, pop() -> 3, pop() -> 2, pop() -> 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,3,5,1,2]
Output: false
Explanation: 1 cannot be popped before 2.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= pushed.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= pushed[i] <= 1000`
- All the elements of `pushed` are **unique**.
- `popped.length == pushed.length`
- `popped` is a permutation of `pushed`.

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool validateStackSequences(vector<int>& pushed, vector<int>& popped) {
        if (pushed.size() != popped.size()) return false;
        int put = 0, take = 0;
        stack<int> s;
        while (put < pushed.size() && take < popped.size()) {
            s.push(pushed[put++]);
            while (!s.empty() && take < popped.size() && s.top() == popped[take]) {
                s.pop();
                take++;
            }
        }
        return take == popped.size();
    }
};

### [1463. Cherry Pickup II](https://leetcode.com/problems/cherry-pickup-ii/)

You are given a `rows x cols` matrix `grid` representing a field of cherries where `grid[i][j]` represents the number of cherries that you can collect from the `(i, j)` cell.

You have two robots that can collect cherries for you:

- **Robot #1** is located at the **top-left corner** `(0, 0)`, and
- **Robot #2** is located at the **top-right corner** `(0, cols - 1)`.

Return *the maximum number of cherries collection using both robots by following the rules below*:

- From a cell `(i, j)`, robots can move to cell `(i + 1, j - 1)`, `(i + 1, j)`, or `(i + 1, j + 1)`.
- When any robot passes through a cell, It picks up all cherries, and the cell becomes an empty cell.
- When both robots stay in the same cell, only one takes the cherries.
- Both robots cannot move outside of the grid at any moment.
- Both robots should reach the bottom row in `grid`.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/29/sample_1_1802.png)

```
Input: grid = [[3,1,1],[2,5,1],[1,5,5],[2,1,1]]
Output: 24
Explanation: Path of robot #1 and #2 are described in color green and blue respectively.
Cherries taken by Robot #1, (3 + 2 + 5 + 2) = 12.
Cherries taken by Robot #2, (1 + 5 + 5 + 1) = 12.
Total of cherries: 12 + 12 = 24.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/23/sample_2_1802.png)

```
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0,0,0,1],[2,0,0,0,0,3,0],[2,0,9,0,0,0,0],[0,3,0,5,4,0,0],[1,0,2,3,0,0,6]]
Output: 28
Explanation: Path of robot #1 and #2 are described in color green and blue respectively.
Cherries taken by Robot #1, (1 + 9 + 5 + 2) = 17.
Cherries taken by Robot #2, (1 + 3 + 4 + 3) = 11.
Total of cherries: 17 + 11 = 28.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `rows == grid.length`
- `cols == grid[i].length`
- `2 <= rows, cols <= 70`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`

#### Solution

DFS+memo

`dp[row][r1][r2]` the maximum number of cherries collection using robot1 and robot2 at row

next row (r1-1, r1, r1+1) and (r2-1, r2, r2+1) total 9 results

Time: `O(9 * m * n^2)`, where `m` is number of rows, `n` is number of cols of `grid`:

- Explain: There are total `m * n^2` states in dp, each state need the loop up to 9 times to compute.

Space: `O(m * n^2)`

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp;
    int DFS(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int row, int r1, int r2) {
        if (row == grid.size()) return 0;
        if (dp[row][r1][r2] >= 0) return dp[row][r1][r2];
        int ans = 0;
        if (row < grid.size()-1)
        for (int i = -1; i <= 1; i++) {
            for (int j = -1; j <= 1; j++) {
                int next_r1 = r1 + i, next_r2 = r2+j;
                if (next_r1 >= 0 && next_r1 < grid[0].size() 
                    && next_r2 >= 0 && next_r2 < grid[0].size()) {
                        ans = max(ans, DFS(grid, row+1, next_r1, next_r2));
                    }
            }
        }
        int num = r1 == r2 ? grid[row][r1] : grid[row][r1] + grid[row][r2];
        dp[row][r1][r2] = ans + num;
        return dp[row][r1][r2];
    }
    int cherryPickup(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int row = grid.size(), col = grid[0].size();
        dp.resize(row, vector<vector<int>>(col, vector<int>(col, -1)));
        return DFS(grid, 0, 0, col-1);
    }
};

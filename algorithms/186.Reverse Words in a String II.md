### [186. Reverse Words in a String II](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string-ii/)

Given a character array `s`, reverse the order of the **words**.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in `s` will be separated by a single space.

Your code must solve the problem **in-place,** i.e. without allocating extra space.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = ["t","h","e"," ","s","k","y"," ","i","s"," ","b","l","u","e"]
Output: ["b","l","u","e"," ","i","s"," ","s","k","y"," ","t","h","e"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = ["a"]
Output: ["a"]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s[i]` is an English letter (uppercase or lowercase), digit, or space `' '`.
- There is **at least one** word in `s`.
- `s` does not contain leading or trailing spaces.
- All the words in `s` are guaranteed to be separated by a single space.

#### Solution

Time complexity: O(n)

Space complexity: O(n)

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    void mySwap(vector<char>& s, int begin, int end) {
        while (begin < end) {
            swap(s[begin++], s[end--]);
        }
    }
    void reverseWords(vector<char>& s) {
        mySwap(s, 0, s.size()-1);
        int begin = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            if (s[i] == ' ') {
                mySwap(s, begin, i-1);
                begin = i+1;
            }
        }
        mySwap(s, begin, s.size()-1);
    }
};
```

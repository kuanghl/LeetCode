### [222. Count Complete Tree Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/)

Given the `root` of a **complete** binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to **[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees)**, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between `1` and `2h` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than `O(n)` time complexity.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/14/complete.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 6
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: 0
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5 * 104]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 104`
- The tree is guaranteed to be **complete**.

#### Solution

For:

```c++
countNodes(root->left) + countNodes(root->right)+1;
```

And since always at least one of the two recursive calls is such a full tree, at least one of the two calls immediately stops. Again we have runtime O(logn^2), first logn for find depth, second logn for recursion.

Time complexity:O(logn^2)

#### Code

```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return 0;
        int l = 1, r = 1;
        auto left = root->left;
        auto right = root->right;
        while (left) {
            l++;
            left = left->left;
        }
        while (right) {
            r++;
            right = right->right;
        }
        if (l == r) return pow(2, l)-1;
        return countNodes(root->left) + countNodes(root->right)+1;
    }
};
```

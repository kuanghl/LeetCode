### [2225. Find Players With Zero or One Losses](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-players-with-zero-or-one-losses/)

You are given an integer array `matches` where `matches[i] = [winneri, loseri]` indicates that the player `winneri` defeated player `loseri` in a match.

Return *a list* `answer` *of size* `2` *where:*

- `answer[0]` is a list of all players that have **not** lost any matches.
- `answer[1]` is a list of all players that have lost exactly **one** match.

The values in the two lists should be returned in **increasing** order.

**Note:**

- You should only consider the players that have played **at least one** match.
- The testcases will be generated such that **no** two matches will have the **same** outcome.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matches = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,6],[5,6],[5,7],[4,5],[4,8],[4,9],[10,4],[10,9]]
Output: [[1,2,10],[4,5,7,8]]
Explanation:
Players 1, 2, and 10 have not lost any matches.
Players 4, 5, 7, and 8 each have lost one match.
Players 3, 6, and 9 each have lost two matches.
Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,10] and answer[1] = [4,5,7,8].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: matches = [[2,3],[1,3],[5,4],[6,4]]
Output: [[1,2,5,6],[]]
Explanation:
Players 1, 2, 5, and 6 have not lost any matches.
Players 3 and 4 each have lost two matches.
Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,5,6] and answer[1] = [].
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= matches.length <= 105`
- `matches[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= winneri, loseri <= 105`
- `winneri != loseri`
- All `matches[i]` are **unique**.

#### Solution

graph, indedgree

Time complexity: O(nlogn)

Space complexity: O(n)

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> findWinners(vector<vector<int>>& matches) {
        unordered_map<int, int> m;
        for (auto& match : matches) {
            m[match[1]]++;
            m.insert({match[0], 0});
        }
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        vector<int> res1, res2;
        for (auto& item : m) {
            if (item.second == 0) {
                res1.push_back(item.first);
            }
            else if (item.second == 1) {
                res2.push_back(item.first);
            }
        }
        sort(res1.begin(), res1.end());
        sort(res2.begin(), res2.end());
        res.push_back(res1);
        res.push_back(res2);
        return res;
    }
};

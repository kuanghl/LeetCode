### 2770. Maximum Number of Jumps to Reach the Last Index

You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` of `n` integers and an integer `target`.

You are initially positioned at index `0`. In one step, you can jump from index `i` to any index `j` such that:

- `0 <= i < j < n`
- `-target <= nums[j] - nums[i] <= target`

Return *the **maximum number of jumps** you can make to reach index* `n - 1`.

If there is no way to reach index `n - 1`, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,6,4,1,2], target = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: To go from index 0 to index n - 1 with the maximum number of jumps, you can perform the following jumping sequence:
- Jump from index 0 to index 1. 
- Jump from index 1 to index 3.
- Jump from index 3 to index 5.
It can be proven that there is no other jumping sequence that goes from 0 to n - 1 with more than 3 jumps. Hence, the answer is 3. 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,6,4,1,2], target = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: To go from index 0 to index n - 1 with the maximum number of jumps, you can perform the following jumping sequence:
- Jump from index 0 to index 1.
- Jump from index 1 to index 2.
- Jump from index 2 to index 3.
- Jump from index 3 to index 4.
- Jump from index 4 to index 5.
It can be proven that there is no other jumping sequence that goes from 0 to n - 1 with more than 5 jumps. Hence, the answer is 5.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,6,4,1,2], target = 0
Output: -1
Explanation: It can be proven that there is no jumping sequence that goes from 0 to n - 1. Hence, the answer is -1.
```



**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length == n <= 1000`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `0 <= target <= 2 * 109`

### Solution

dp[j] means *the **maximum number of jumps** you can make to reach* index j

dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[i] + 1) if (`0<=i<j<n` and `-target <= nums[j] - nums[i] <= target`)

dp[0] =0

i from 1 to nums.size()-1, j from 0 to i

#### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumJumps(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        vector<int> dp(nums.size(), 0);
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                int tmp = nums[i] - nums[j];
                if (tmp <= target && tmp >= -target) {
                    if (j > 0 && dp[j] == 0) {
                        continue;
                    }
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[nums.size() - 1] == 0 ? -1 : dp[nums.size() - 1];
    }
};
```

### [759. Employee Free Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-free-time/)

We are given a list `schedule` of employees, which represents the working time for each employee.

Each employee has a list of non-overlapping `Intervals`, and these intervals are in sorted order.

Return the list of finite intervals representing **common, positive-length free time** for *all* employees, also in sorted order.

(Even though we are representing `Intervals` in the form `[x, y]`, the objects inside are `Intervals`, not lists or arrays. For example, `schedule[0][0].start = 1`, `schedule[0][0].end = 2`, and `schedule[0][0][0]` is not defined). Also, we wouldn't include intervals like [5, 5] in our answer, as they have zero length.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: schedule = [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]
Output: [[3,4]]
Explanation: There are a total of three employees, and all common
free time intervals would be [-inf, 1], [3, 4], [10, inf].
We discard any intervals that contain inf as they aren't finite.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: schedule = [[[1,3],[6,7]],[[2,4]],[[2,5],[9,12]]]
Output: [[5,6],[7,9]]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= schedule.length , schedule[i].length <= 50`
- `0 <= schedule[i].start < schedule[i].end <= 10^8`

        vector<vector<int>> tables;
        for (auto& item : schedule) {
            for (auto& interval : item) {
                tables.push_back({interval.start, interval.end});
            }
        }
        sort(tables.begin(), tables.end());
        vector<Interval> res;
        for (int i = 1, st = tables[0][1]; i < tables.size(); st = tables[i][1], i++) {
            while (i < tables.size() && tables[i][0] <= st) {
                st = max(st, tables[i][1]);
                i++;
            }
            if (i < tables.size()) {
                res.push_back(Interval(st, tables[i][0]));
            }
            else break;
        }
        return res;

    }

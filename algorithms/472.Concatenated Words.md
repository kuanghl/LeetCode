### [472. Concatenated Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenated-words/)

Given an array of strings `words` (**without duplicates**), return *all the **concatenated words** in the given list of* `words`.

A **concatenated word** is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words (not necessarily distinct) in the given array.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]
Output: ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]
Explanation: "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats"; 
"dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; 
"ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["cat","dog","catdog"]
Output: ["catdog"]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 104`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`
- `words[i]` consists of only lowercase English letters.
- All the strings of `words` are **unique**.
- `1 <= sum(words[i].length) <= 105`

#### Solution

iteration+word break dp

for each word, dp[j]=k means word [0, j-1] can be decomposed into at most k words

dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[i] + 1) if [i, j-1] in the words and (dp[i]>0 if i > 0 or i ==0)

dp[0] = 0

time complexity: O(N)

space complexity: O(N)

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict(vector<string>& words) {
        vector<string> res;
        unordered_set<string> s(words.begin(), words.end());
        for (auto& word : words) {
            vector<int> dp(word.size()+1, 0);
            for (int j = 1; j <= word.size(); j++) {
                for (int i = 0; i < j; i++) {
                    if (i == 0 || dp[i] > 0) {
                        if (s.find(word.substr(i, j-i)) != s.end()) {
                            dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[i] + 1);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            if (dp.back() > 1) {
                res.push_back(word);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

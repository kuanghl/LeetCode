### [2473. Minimum Cost to Buy Apples](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-buy-apples/)

You are given a positive integer `n` representing `n` cities numbered from `1` to `n`. You are also given a **2D** array `roads`, where `roads[i] = [ai, bi, costi]` indicates that there is a **bidirectional** road between cities `ai` and `bi` with a cost of traveling equal to `costi`.

You can buy apples in **any** city you want, but some cities have different costs to buy apples. You are given the 1-based array `appleCost` where `appleCost[i]` is the cost of buying one apple from city `i`.

You start at some city, traverse through various roads, and eventually buy **exactly** one apple from **any** city. After you buy that apple, you have to return back to the city you **started** at, but now the cost of all the roads will be **multiplied** by a given factor `k`.

Given the integer `k`, return *a 1-based array* `answer` *of size* `n` *where* `answer[i]` *is the **minimum** total cost to buy an apple if you start at city* `i`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 4, roads = [[1,2,4],[2,3,2],[2,4,5],[3,4,1],[1,3,4]], appleCost = [56,42,102,301], k = 2
Output: [54,42,48,51]
Explanation: The minimum cost for each starting city is the following:
- Starting at city 1: You take the path 1 -> 2, buy an apple at city 2, and finally take the path 2 -> 1. The total cost is 4 + 42 + 4 * 2 = 54.
- Starting at city 2: You directly buy an apple at city 2. The total cost is 42.
- Starting at city 3: You take the path 3 -> 2, buy an apple at city 2, and finally take the path 2 -> 3. The total cost is 2 + 42 + 2 * 2 = 48.
- Starting at city 4: You take the path 4 -> 3 -> 2 then you buy at city 2, and finally take the path 2 -> 3 -> 4. The total cost is 1 + 2 + 42 + 1 * 2 + 2 * 2 = 51.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 3, roads = [[1,2,5],[2,3,1],[3,1,2]], appleCost = [2,3,1], k = 3
Output: [2,3,1]
Explanation: It is always optimal to buy the apple in the starting city.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 1000`
- `1 <= roads.length <= 2000`
- `1 <= ai, bi <= n`
- `ai != bi`
- `1 <= costi <= 105`
- `appleCost.length == n`
- `1 <= appleCost[i] <= 105`
- `1 <= k <= 100`
- There are no repeated edges.

#### Solution

Dijkstra (BFS + memory)

if next node has calculated min cost, cost = min(cost, next_node_min_cost+(k+1)*cur_path)

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<long long> minCost(int n, vector<vector<int>>& roads, vector<int>& appleCost, int k) {
        vector<long long> res(n, 0);
        unordered_map<int, vector<pair<int, int>>> paths;
        for (auto& road : roads) {
            paths[road[0]-1].push_back({road[1]-1, road[2]});
            paths[road[1]-1].push_back({road[0]-1, road[2]});
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            priority_queue<pair<long long, int>, vector<pair<long long, int>>, 
                std::greater<pair<long long, int>>> q;
            unordered_map<int, long long> visited;
            q.push({0, i});
            visited[i] = 0;
            long long cost = appleCost[i];
            while (!q.empty()) {
                auto [cur_cost, cur] = q.top();
                q.pop();
                cost = min(cost, (k+1)*cur_cost + appleCost[cur]);
                for (auto& next : paths[cur]) {
                    if (cur_cost + next.second > cost) continue;
                    // use cache
                    if (res[next.first] != 0) {
                        cost = min(cost, res[next.first] + (cur_cost + next.second)*(k+1));
                        continue;
                    }
                    if (visited.find(next.first) == visited.end()
                        || cur_cost + next.second < visited[next.first]) {
                            visited[next.first] = cur_cost + next.second;
                            q.push({cur_cost + next.second, next.first});
                        }
                }
            }
            res[i] = cost;
        }
        return res;
    }
};

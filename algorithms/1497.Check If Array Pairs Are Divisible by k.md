### [1497. Check If Array Pairs Are Divisible by k](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-array-pairs-are-divisible-by-k/)

Given an array of integers `arr` of even length `n` and an integer `k`.

We want to divide the array into exactly `n / 2` pairs such that the sum of each pair is divisible by `k`.

Return `true` *If you can find a way to do that or* `false` *otherwise*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,10,6,7,8,9], k = 5
Output: true
Explanation: Pairs are (1,9),(2,8),(3,7),(4,6) and (5,10).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6], k = 7
Output: true
Explanation: Pairs are (1,6),(2,5) and(3,4).
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6], k = 10
Output: false
Explanation: You can try all possible pairs to see that there is no way to divide arr into 3 pairs each with sum divisible by 10.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `arr.length == n`
- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `n` is even.
- `-109 <= arr[i] <= 109`
- `1 <= k <= 105`

#### Solution

# Intuition

The goal is to pair elements in the array such that the sum of each pair is divisible by a given integer ( k ). For two integers ( a ) and ( b ), their sum ( (a + b) ) is divisible by ( k ) if the sum of their remainders when divided by ( k ) is either ( k ) or ( 0 ). This leads us to consider the remainders of each element when divided by ( k ).

# Approach

1. **Calculate Remainders**:

   - For each number in the array, calculate its remainder when divided by ( k ). If the remainder is negative, convert it to a positive remainder by adding ( k ).

2. **Frequency Count**:

   - Maintain a frequency array `freq` where `freq[i]` counts how many numbers in the array give a remainder of ( i ) when divided by ( k ).

3. **Check Pairs**:

   - **Divisible by ( k )**: If a number has a remainder of ( 0 ), it must be paired with another number that also has a remainder of ( 0 ). Therefore, `freq[0]` should be even.

   - Pairs of Remainders

     : For any remainder ( i ), it must be paired with ( k - i ). This means that freq[i] must equal freq[k - i].

     - Specifically, for ( i = 1 ) to ( k/2 ), check that `freq[i]` matches `freq[k - i]`.

   - Handle the special case when ( k ) is even: when ( i = k/2 ), the numbers with this remainder must also be paired with each other, requiring that `freq[k/2]` be even.

4. **Return Result**:

   - If all conditions are satisfied, return true; otherwise, return false.

Time complexity: O(n)

Space complexity: O(n)

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool canArrange(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        unordered_map<int, int> m;
        for (auto& num : arr) {
            if (num%k < 0) m[num%k+k]++;
            else m[num%k]++;
        }
        if (m[0]%2 != 0) return false;
        if (k%2==0 && m[k/2] %2 != 0) return false;
        for (int i = 1; i < k; i++) {
            if (m[i] != m[k-i]) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
};

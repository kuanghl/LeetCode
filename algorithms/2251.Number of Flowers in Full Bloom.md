### [2251. Number of Flowers in Full Bloom](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-flowers-in-full-bloom/)

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `flowers`, where `flowers[i] = [starti, endi]` means the `ith` flower will be in **full bloom** from `starti` to `endi` (**inclusive**). You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array `people` of size `n`, where `people[i]` is the time that the `ith` person will arrive to see the flowers.

Return *an integer array* `answer` *of size* `n`*, where* `answer[i]` *is the **number** of flowers that are in full bloom when the* `ith` *person arrives.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: flowers = [[1,6],[3,7],[9,12],[4,13]], people = [2,3,7,11]
Output: [1,2,2,2]
Explanation: The figure above shows the times when the flowers are in full bloom and when the people arrive.
For each person, we return the number of flowers in full bloom during their arrival.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/02/ex2new.jpg)

```
Input: flowers = [[1,10],[3,3]], people = [3,3,2]
Output: [2,2,1]
Explanation: The figure above shows the times when the flowers are in full bloom and when the people arrive.
For each person, we return the number of flowers in full bloom during their arrival.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= flowers.length <= 5 * 104`
- `flowers[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= starti <= endi <= 109`
- `1 <= people.length <= 5 * 104`
- `1 <= people[i] <= 109`

#### 解析

区间问题，用上下车解决，多了一个维度而已

#### 代码

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> fullBloomFlowers(vector<vector<int>>& flowers, vector<int>& people) {
        int n = flowers.size();
        int p_n = people.size();
        vector<int> begins(n, 0);
        vector<int> ends(n, 0);
        map<int, vector<int>> m_index;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            auto& flower = flowers[i];
            begins[i] = flower[0];
            ends[i] = flower[1];
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < p_n; i++) {
            m_index[people[i]].push_back(i);
        }
        sort(begins.begin(), begins.end());
        sort(ends.begin(), ends.end());
        sort(people.begin(), people.end());
        int cur = 0;
        int b = 0, e = 0, p = 0;
        vector<int> res(people.size(), 0);
        int num = 0;
        while (p < p_n) {
            if (b < n && begins[b] <= people[p] && begins[b] <= ends[e]) {
                cur++;
                b++;
            }
            else if (e < n && (b >= n || ends[e] < begins[b]) && ends[e] < people[p]) {
                cur--;
                e++;
            }
            else {
                int time = people[p];
                for (auto& index : m_index[time]) {
                    res[index] = cur;
                    p++;
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};

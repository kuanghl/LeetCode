### [1634. Add Two Polynomials Represented as Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-polynomials-represented-as-linked-lists/)

A polynomial linked list is a special type of linked list where every node represents a term in a polynomial expression.

Each node has three attributes:

- `coefficient`: an integer representing the number multiplier of the term. The coefficient of the term `**9**x4` is `9`.
- `power`: an integer representing the exponent. The power of the term `9x**4**` is `4`.
- `next`: a pointer to the next node in the list, or `null` if it is the last node of the list.

For example, the polynomial `5x3 + 4x - 7` is represented by the polynomial linked list illustrated below:

The polynomial linked list must be in its standard form: the polynomial must be in **strictly** descending order by its `power` value. Also, terms with a `coefficient` of `0` are omitted.

Given two polynomial linked list heads, `poly1` and `poly2`, add the polynomials together and return *the head of the sum of the polynomials*.

**`PolyNode` format:**

The input/output format is as a list of `n` nodes, where each node is represented as its `[coefficient, power]`. For example, the polynomial `5x3 + 4x - 7` would be represented as: `[[5,3],[4,1],[-7,0]]`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: poly1 = [[1,1]], poly2 = [[1,0]]
Output: [[1,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: poly1 = x. poly2 = 1. The sum is x + 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: poly1 = [[2,2],[4,1],[3,0]], poly2 = [[3,2],[-4,1],[-1,0]]
Output: [[5,2],[2,0]]
Explanation: poly1 = 2x2 + 4x + 3. poly2 = 3x2 - 4x - 1. The sum is 5x2 + 2. Notice that we omit the "0x" term.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: poly1 = [[1,2]], poly2 = [[-1,2]]
Output: []
Explanation: The sum is 0. We return an empty list.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= n <= 104`
- `-109 <= PolyNode.coefficient <= 109`
- `PolyNode.coefficient != 0`
- `0 <= PolyNode.power <= 109`
- `PolyNode.power > PolyNode.next.power`

#### Solution

Time complexity: O(N)

Space complexity: O(N)

Two list add.  Note that the eliminated nodes should be removed at the end.

#### Code

```c++
/**
 * Definition for polynomial singly-linked list.
 * struct PolyNode {
 *     int coefficient, power;
 *     PolyNode *next;
 *     PolyNode(): coefficient(0), power(0), next(nullptr) {};
 *     PolyNode(int x, int y): coefficient(x), power(y), next(nullptr) {};
 *     PolyNode(int x, int y, PolyNode* next): coefficient(x), power(y), next(next) {};
 * };

class Solution {
public:
    PolyNode* addPoly(PolyNode* poly1, PolyNode* poly2) {
        PolyNode dummy;
        PolyNode* root = &dummy;
        auto *p1 = poly1, *p2 = poly2;
        while (p1 && p2) {
            if (p1->power > p2->power) {
                root->next = p1;
                root = root->next;
                p1 = p1->next;
            }
            else if (p1->power < p2->power) {
                root->next = p2;
                root = root->next;
                p2 = p2->next;
            }
            else {
                int res = p1->coefficient + p2->coefficient;
                if (res != 0) {
                    root->next = new PolyNode(res, p1->power);
                    root = root->next;
                }
                p1 = p1->next;
                p2 = p2->next;
            }
        }
        // remove the eliminated nodes.
        if (!p1 && !p2) {
            root->next = nullptr;
        }

        if (p1) {
            root->next = p1;
        }
        if (p2) {
            root->next = p2;
        }
        return dummy.next;
    }
};

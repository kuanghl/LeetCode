### 518. Coin Change II

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return *the number of combinations that make up that amount*. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `0`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

The answer is **guaranteed** to fit into a signed **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: amount = 5, coins = [1,2,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= coins.length <= 300`
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 5000`
- All the values of `coins` are **unique**.
- `0 <= amount <= 5000`

### Solution

// Unbounded Knapsack Problem
// becasue each coin can be put more than once, it is a Unbounded Knapsack Problem.
// dp[j] means the number of combinations that make up j
// dp[j] += dp[j - coins[i]] (because is the number of combinations)
// dp[0] = 1 (one way to 0: 0=0)
// i from 0 to coins.size()-1, j from coins[i] to amount

#### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int change(int amount, vector<int>& coins) {
        vector<int> dp(amount+1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < coins.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = coins[i]; j <= amount; j++) {
                dp[j] += dp[j - coins[i]];
            }
        }
        return dp[amount];
    }
};
```

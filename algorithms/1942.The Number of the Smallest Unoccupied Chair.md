### [1942. The Number of the Smallest Unoccupied Chair](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-the-smallest-unoccupied-chair/)

There is a party where `n` friends numbered from `0` to `n - 1` are attending. There is an **infinite** number of chairs in this party that are numbered from `0` to `infinity`. When a friend arrives at the party, they sit on the unoccupied chair with the **smallest number**.

- For example, if chairs `0`, `1`, and `5` are occupied when a friend comes, they will sit on chair number `2`.

When a friend leaves the party, their chair becomes unoccupied at the moment they leave. If another friend arrives at that same moment, they can sit in that chair.

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `times` where `times[i] = [arrivali, leavingi]`, indicating the arrival and leaving times of the `ith` friend respectively, and an integer `targetFriend`. All arrival times are **distinct**.

Return *the **chair number** that the friend numbered* `targetFriend` *will sit on*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: times = [[1,4],[2,3],[4,6]], targetFriend = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: 
- Friend 0 arrives at time 1 and sits on chair 0.
- Friend 1 arrives at time 2 and sits on chair 1.
- Friend 1 leaves at time 3 and chair 1 becomes empty.
- Friend 0 leaves at time 4 and chair 0 becomes empty.
- Friend 2 arrives at time 4 and sits on chair 0.
Since friend 1 sat on chair 1, we return 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: times = [[3,10],[1,5],[2,6]], targetFriend = 0
Output: 2
Explanation: 
- Friend 1 arrives at time 1 and sits on chair 0.
- Friend 2 arrives at time 2 and sits on chair 1.
- Friend 0 arrives at time 3 and sits on chair 2.
- Friend 1 leaves at time 5 and chair 0 becomes empty.
- Friend 2 leaves at time 6 and chair 1 becomes empty.
- Friend 0 leaves at time 10 and chair 2 becomes empty.
Since friend 0 sat on chair 2, we return 2.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == times.length`
- `2 <= n <= 104`
- `times[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= arrivali < leavingi <= 105`
- `0 <= targetFriend <= n - 1`
- Each `arrivali` time is **distinct**.

#### Solution

meeting zoom + priority_queue (can_use)

when there are not enough chairs (can_use is empty), we add chairs.

We also need a hashmap to record the used chairs.

time complexity: O(nlog)

space complexity: O(n)

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int smallestChair(vector<vector<int>>& times, int targetFriend) {
        vector<vector<int>> begins;
        vector<vector<int>> ends;
        for (int i = 0; i < times.size(); i++) {
            begins.push_back({times[i][0], i});
            ends.push_back({times[i][1], i});
        }
        sort(begins.begin(), begins.end());
        sort(ends.begin(), ends.end());
        // next one we can use
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> can_use;
        can_use.push(0);
        // people->chair number
        unordered_map<int, int> used;
        int b = 0, e = 0;
        int max_chair = 0;
        while (b < begins.size()) {
            if (ends[e][0] <= begins[b][0]) {
                can_use.push(used[ends[e][1]]);
                e++;
            }
            else {
                int chair = 0;
                if (can_use.empty()) {
                    ++max_chair;
                    chair = max_chair;
                }
                else {
                    chair = can_use.top();
                    can_use.pop();
                }
                if (begins[b][1] == targetFriend) return chair;
                used[begins[b][1]] = chair;
                b++;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```

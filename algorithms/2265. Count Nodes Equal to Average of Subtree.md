### [2265. Count Nodes Equal to Average of Subtree](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-nodes-equal-to-average-of-subtree/)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the number of nodes where the value of the node is equal to the **average** of the values in its **subtree***.

**Note:**

- The **average** of `n` elements is the **sum** of the `n` elements divided by `n` and **rounded down** to the nearest integer.
- A **subtree** of `root` is a tree consisting of `root` and all of its descendants.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [4,8,5,0,1,null,6]
Output: 5
Explanation: 
For the node with value 4: The average of its subtree is (4 + 8 + 5 + 0 + 1 + 6) / 6 = 24 / 6 = 4.
For the node with value 5: The average of its subtree is (5 + 6) / 2 = 11 / 2 = 5.
For the node with value 0: The average of its subtree is 0 / 1 = 0.
For the node with value 1: The average of its subtree is 1 / 1 = 1.
For the node with value 6: The average of its subtree is 6 / 1 = 6.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/26/image-20220326133920-1.png)

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: For the node with value 1: The average of its subtree is 1 / 1 = 1.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`

#### Solution

#### Code

1. CPP version

```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> averageOfSubtree(TreeNode* root, int& res) {
        if (!root) {
            return {0, 0};
        }
        auto left = averageOfSubtree(root->left, res);
        auto right = averageOfSubtree(root->right, res);
        int sum = left[0] + right[0] + root->val;
        int nodes = left[1]+right[1]+1;
        if (root->val == sum / nodes) res++;
        return {sum, nodes};
    }
    int averageOfSubtree(TreeNode* root) {
        int res = 0;
        averageOfSubtree(root, res);
        return res;
    }
};
```

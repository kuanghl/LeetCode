### 746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs

You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `ith` step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.

Return *the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: cost = [10,15,20]
Output: 15
Explanation: You will start at index 1.
- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
The total cost is 15.
```

**Example 2:**

```
IInput: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: You will start at index 0.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
The total cost is 6.
```

### Solution

```cpp
// 1. dp[i] minimum cost to reach the ith floor
// 2. dp[i] = min(dp[i-1] + cost[i-1], dp[i-2] + cost[i-2])
// 3. dp[0] = 0, dp[1] = 0
// 4. loop from 2 to size+1
```

```c++

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if (root->val > p->val && root->val > q->val) return lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
        else if (root->val < p->val && root->val < q->val) return lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q);
        return root;
    }
};

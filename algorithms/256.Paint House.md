### [256. Paint House](https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-house/)

There is a row of `n` houses, where each house can be painted one of three colors: red, blue, or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an `n x 3` cost matrix `costs`.

- For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house `0` with the color red; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on...

Return *the minimum cost to paint all houses*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: costs = [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
Output: 10
Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue.
Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: costs = [[7,6,2]]
Output: 2
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `costs.length == n`
- `costs[i].length == 3`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= costs[i][j] <= 20`

#### Solution

DP

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(vector<vector<int>>& costs) {
        int red = costs[0][0], green = costs[0][1], blue = costs[0][2];
        for (int i = 1; i < costs.size(); i++) {
            int tmp1 = red, tmp2 = green, tmp3 = blue;
            red = min(tmp2+costs[i][0], tmp3+costs[i][0]);
            green = min(tmp1+costs[i][1], tmp3+costs[i][1]);
            blue = min(tmp1+costs[i][2], tmp2+costs[i][2]);
        }
        return min(red, min(green, blue));
    }
};
```

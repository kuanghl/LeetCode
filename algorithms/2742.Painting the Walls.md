### [2742. Painting the Walls](https://leetcode.com/problems/painting-the-walls/)

You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays, `cost` and `time`, of size `n` representing the costs and the time taken to paint `n` different walls respectively. There are two painters available:

- A **paid painter** that paints the `ith` wall in `time[i]` units of time and takes `cost[i]` units of money.
- A **free painter** that paints **any** wall in `1` unit of time at a cost of `0`. But the free painter can only be used if the paid painter is already **occupied**.

Return *the minimum amount of money required to paint the* `n` *walls.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: cost = [1,2,3,2], time = [1,2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: The walls at index 0 and 1 will be painted by the paid painter, and it will take 3 units of time; meanwhile, the free painter will paint the walls at index 2 and 3, free of cost in 2 units of time. Thus, the total cost is 1 + 2 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: cost = [2,3,4,2], time = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: The walls at index 0 and 3 will be painted by the paid painter, and it will take 2 units of time; meanwhile, the free painter will paint the walls at index 1 and 2, free of cost in 2 units of time. Thus, the total cost is 2 + 2 = 4.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= cost.length <= 500`
- `cost.length == time.length`
- `1 <= cost[i] <= 106`
- `1 <= time[i] <= 500`

#### Solution

0-1 knapsack problem

dp[i] = c means the minimum cost to finish i walls is c

for every cost[j], we can finish `time[j]+1` walls, so

`dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[max(i-time[j]-1, 0)]+cost[j])`

because even wall < cost, need also have cost, so is `dp[max(i-time[j]-1, 0)]`

dp[0] = 0

j from [n, 0]

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int paintWalls(vector<int>& cost, vector<int>& time) {
        int n = cost.size();
        vector<long long> dp(n+1, INT_MAX);
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            for (int i = n; i >= 0; i--) {
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[max(i-time[j]-1, 0)]+cost[j]);
            }
        }

        return dp.back();
    }
};
```

### [1776. Car Fleet II](https://leetcode.com/problems/car-fleet-ii/)

There are `n` cars traveling at different speeds in the same direction along a one-lane road. You are given an array `cars` of length `n`, where `cars[i] = [positioni, speedi]` represents:

- `positioni` is the distance between the `ith` car and the beginning of the road in meters. It is guaranteed that `positioni < positioni+1`.
- `speedi` is the initial speed of the `ith` car in meters per second.

For simplicity, cars can be considered as points moving along the number line. Two cars collide when they occupy the same position. Once a car collides with another car, they unite and form a single car fleet. The cars in the formed fleet will have the same position and the same speed, which is the initial speed of the **slowest** car in the fleet.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the time, in seconds, at which the `ith` car collides with the next car, or `-1` if the car does not collide with the next car. Answers within `10-5` of the actual answers are accepted.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: cars = [[1,2],[2,1],[4,3],[7,2]]
Output: [1.00000,-1.00000,3.00000,-1.00000]
Explanation: After exactly one second, the first car will collide with the second car, and form a car fleet with speed 1 m/s. After exactly 3 seconds, the third car will collide with the fourth car, and form a car fleet with speed 2 m/s.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: cars = [[3,4],[5,4],[6,3],[9,1]]
Output: [2.00000,1.00000,1.50000,-1.00000]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= cars.length <= 105`
- `1 <= positioni, speedi <= 106`
- `positioni < positioni+1`

#### 解析

单调栈问题。从右向左，使用单调递减栈，栈中存pos, speed, collides time。

1. 当前speed比栈顶的大，并且能在栈顶collides time前collide，则直接push进并设置res；否则pop stack，直到找到一个符合前面条件的结果
2. 当前speed比栈顶的小，则pop stack直到找到一个speed 比栈顶大的，然后跳到step 1.

#### 代码

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<double> getCollisionTimes(vector<vector<int>>& cars) {
        int n = cars.size();
        vector<double> res(n, 0);
        // pos, speed, time of collides with the next car
        stack<vector<int>> s;
        res[n-1] = -1.0;
        s.push({cars[n-1][0], cars[n-1][1], n-1});
        int i = n-2;
        while (i >= 0) {
            if (cars[i][1] > s.top()[1]) {
                while (!s.empty() && cars[i][1] > s.top()[1]) {
                    double pos = cars[i][0]+cars[i][1]*res[s.top()[2]];
                    double next_pos = s.top()[0]+s.top()[1]*res[s.top()[2]];
                    if (res[s.top()[2]] < 0 || pos >= next_pos) {
                        double cost_time = (double)(s.top()[0] - cars[i][0]) / (double)(cars[i][1] - s.top()[1]);

                        s.push({cars[i][0], cars[i][1], i});
                        res[i] = cost_time;
                        i--;
                        break;
                    }
                    s.pop();
                }
            }
            else {
                while (!s.empty() && cars[i][1] <= s.top()[1]) {
                    s.pop();
                }
                if (s.empty()) {
                    res[i] = -1.0;
                    s.push({cars[i][0], cars[i][1], i});
                    i--;
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};

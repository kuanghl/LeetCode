### [1578. Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-make-rope-colorful/)

Alice has `n` balloons arranged on a rope. You are given a **0-indexed** string `colors` where `colors[i]` is the color of the `ith` balloon.

Alice wants the rope to be **colorful**. She does not want **two consecutive balloons** to be of the same color, so she asks Bob for help. Bob can remove some balloons from the rope to make it **colorful**. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `neededTime` where `neededTime[i]` is the time (in seconds) that Bob needs to remove the `ith` balloon from the rope.

Return *the **minimum time** Bob needs to make the rope **colorful***.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/13/ballon1.jpg)

```
Input: colors = "abaac", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: In the above image, 'a' is blue, 'b' is red, and 'c' is green.
Bob can remove the blue balloon at index 2. This takes 3 seconds.
There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/13/balloon2.jpg)

```
Input: colors = "abc", neededTime = [1,2,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: The rope is already colorful. Bob does not need to remove any balloons from the rope.
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/13/balloon3.jpg)

```
Input: colors = "aabaa", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Bob will remove the ballons at indices 0 and 4. Each ballon takes 1 second to remove.
There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 1 + 1 = 2.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == colors.length == neededTime.length`
- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `1 <= neededTime[i] <= 104`
- `colors` contains only lowercase English letters.

#### Solution

Slide windows.

#### Code

1. CPP version

```c++
// slide windows
class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(string colors, vector<int>& neededTime) {
        char cur = 0;
        int max_val = 0, sum = 0;
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < colors.size(); i++) {
            if (0 == cur || colors[i] != cur) {
                res += sum - max_val;
                sum = neededTime[i];
                max_val = neededTime[i];
                cur = colors[i];
            }
            else {
                max_val = max(max_val, neededTime[i]);
                sum += neededTime[i];
            }
        }
        res += sum - max_val;
        return res;
    }
};
```

2. Python version

```python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, colors: str, neededTime: List[int]) -> int:
        cur = 0
        max_val, sums, res = [0,0,0]
        for i, v in enumerate(colors):
            if cur == 0 or v != cur:
                res += sums - max_val
                sums = neededTime[i]
                max_val = neededTime[i]
                cur = v
            else:
                sums += neededTime[i]
                max_val = max(max_val, neededTime[i])
        res += sums - max_val
        return res
```

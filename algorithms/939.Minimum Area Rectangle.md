### [939. Minimum Area Rectangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-area-rectangle/)

You are given an array of points in the **X-Y** plane `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`.

Return *the minimum area of a rectangle formed from these points, with sides parallel to the X and Y axes*. If there is not any such rectangle, return `0`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: points = [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[2,2]]
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[4,1],[4,3]]
Output: 2
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= points.length <= 500`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= xi, yi <= 4 * 104`
- All the given points are **unique**.

#### Solution

500, so O(n^3) can pass, just make points to lines which are parallel to the Y axes, and find the lines have same length and bottom points have same Y axes.

#### Code

1. CPP version

```c++

```

2. Python version

```python
class Solution:
    def minAreaRect(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        memo = defaultdict(list)
        xs = defaultdict(list)
        for point in points:
            xs[point[0]].append(point[1])
        for k,v in xs.items():
            n = len(v)
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(i+1, n):
                    diff = abs(v[i]-v[j])
                    memo[diff].append([k, min(v[i], v[j])])
        res = 0
        for k,v in memo.items():
            n = len(v)
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(i+1, n):
                    if v[i][1] == v[j][1]:
                        dis = abs(v[i][0]-v[j][0])
                        res = min(res, dis*k) if res != 0 else dis*k
        return res

```

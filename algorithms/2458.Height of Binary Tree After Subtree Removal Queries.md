### [2458. Height of Binary Tree After Subtree Removal Queries](https://leetcode.com/problems/height-of-binary-tree-after-subtree-removal-queries/)

You are given the `root` of a **binary tree** with `n` nodes. Each node is assigned a unique value from `1` to `n`. You are also given an array `queries` of size `m`.

You have to perform `m` **independent** queries on the tree where in the `ith` query you do the following:

- **Remove** the subtree rooted at the node with the value `queries[i]` from the tree. It is **guaranteed** that `queries[i]` will **not** be equal to the value of the root.

Return *an array* `answer` *of size* `m` *where* `answer[i]` *is the height of the tree after performing the* `ith` *query*.

**Note**:

- The queries are independent, so the tree returns to its **initial** state after each query.
- The height of a tree is the **number of edges in the longest simple path** from the root to some node in the tree.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,3,4,2,null,6,5,null,null,null,null,null,7], queries = [4]
Output: [2]
Explanation: The diagram above shows the tree after removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4.
The height of the tree is 2 (The path 1 -> 3 -> 2).
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/07/binaryytreeedrawio-2.png)

```
Input: root = [5,8,9,2,1,3,7,4,6], queries = [3,2,4,8]
Output: [3,2,3,2]
Explanation: We have the following queries:
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 3. The height of the tree becomes 3 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 4).
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 2. The height of the tree becomes 2 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 1).
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4. The height of the tree becomes 3 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 6).
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 8. The height of the tree becomes 2 (The path 5 -> 9 -> 3).
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
- `2 <= n <= 105`
- `1 <= Node.val <= n`
- All the values in the tree are **unique**.
- `m == queries.length`
- `1 <= m <= min(n, 104)`
- `1 <= queries[i] <= n`
- `queries[i] != root.val`

#### 解析

先层次遍历，将每个level对应的node的height排序，并记录node对应的level和height，然后遍历queries，根据node与兄弟结点的height情况输出结果。

时间复杂度: O(N)

 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}

            }
            else {

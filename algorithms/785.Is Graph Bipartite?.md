### [785. Is Graph Bipartite?](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-graph-bipartite/)

There is an **undirected** graph with `n` nodes, where each node is numbered between `0` and `n - 1`. You are given a 2D array `graph`, where `graph[u]` is an array of nodes that node `u` is adjacent to. More formally, for each `v` in `graph[u]`, there is an undirected edge between node `u` and node `v`. The graph has the following properties:

- There are no self-edges (`graph[u]` does not contain `u`).
- There are no parallel edges (`graph[u]` does not contain duplicate values).
- If `v` is in `graph[u]`, then `u` is in `graph[v]` (the graph is undirected).
- The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes `u` and `v` such that there is no path between them.

A graph is **bipartite** if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets `A` and `B` such that **every** edge in the graph connects a node in set `A` and a node in set `B`.

Return `true` *if and only if it is **bipartite***.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/21/bi2.jpg)

```
Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/21/bi1.jpg)

```
Input: graph = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: We can partition the nodes into two sets: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `graph.length == n`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `0 <= graph[u].length < n`
- `0 <= graph[u][i] <= n - 1`
- `graph[u]` does not contain `u`.
- All the values of `graph[u]` are **unique**.
- If `graph[u]` contains `v`, then `graph[v]` contains `u`.

                    auto [cur, is_s1] = q.front();q.pop();
                    if (m.find(cur) != m.end() && m[cur] != is_s1) {

                        if (m.find(next) == m.end()) {
                            q.push({next, !is_s1});
                        }
                    }
                }

### [348. Design Tic-Tac-Toe](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tic-tac-toe/)

Assume the following rules are for the tic-tac-toe game on an `n x n` board between two players:

1. A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
2. Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves are allowed.
3. A player who succeeds in placing `n` of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

Implement the `TicTacToe` class:

- `TicTacToe(int n)` Initializes the object the size of the board `n`.

- ```
  int move(int row, int col, int player)
  ```

   

  Indicates that the player with id

   

  ```
  player
  ```

   

  plays at the cell

   

  ```
  (row, col)
  ```

   

  of the board. The move is guaranteed to be a valid move, and the two players alternate in making moves. Return

  - `0` if there is **no winner** after the move,
  - `1` if **player 1** is the winner after the move, or
  - `2` if **player 2** is the winner after the move.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["TicTacToe", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move"]
[[3], [0, 0, 1], [0, 2, 2], [2, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 0, 2], [2, 1, 1]]
Output
[null, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

Explanation
TicTacToe ticTacToe = new TicTacToe(3);
Assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.
ticTacToe.move(0, 0, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| | |
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
| | | |

ticTacToe.move(0, 2, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
| | | |

ticTacToe.move(2, 2, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
| | |X|

ticTacToe.move(1, 1, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
| | |X|

ticTacToe.move(2, 0, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
|X| |X|

ticTacToe.move(1, 0, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
|X| |X|

ticTacToe.move(2, 1, 1); // return 1 (player 1 wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
|X|X|X|
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 100`
- player is `1` or `2`.
- `0 <= row, col < n`
- `(row, col)` are **unique** for each different call to `move`.
- At most `n2` calls will be made to `move`.

 

**Follow-up:** Could you do better than `O(n2)` per `move()` operation?

#### Solution

using rows, cols, diagonals to store the number of players.

Time complexity:O(1)

Space complexity:O(n)

#### Code

```c++
class TicTacToe {
    // number of player1, player2
    vector<vector<int>> rows;
    vector<vector<int>> cols;
    vector<vector<int>> diagonals;
    int winner;
    int size;
public:
    TicTacToe(int n) {
        rows.resize(n, vector<int>(2, 0));
        cols.resize(n, vector<int>(2, 0));
        diagonals.resize(2, vector<int>(2, 0));
        winner = 0;
        size = n;
    }
    
    int move(int row, int col, int player) {
        if (winner > 0) return winner;
        rows[row][player-1]++;
        cols[col][player-1]++;
        if (row==col) {
            diagonals[0][player-1]++;
            // center
            if (size & 1 && row == size / 2) {
                diagonals[1][player-1]++;
            }
        }
        else if (row == size-1-col) {
            diagonals[1][player-1]++;
            // center
            if (size & 1 && row == size / 2) {
                diagonals[0][player-1]++;
            }
        }
        if (rows[row][player-1] == size || cols[col][player-1] == size 
            || diagonals[0][player-1] == size || diagonals[1][player-1] == size) {
                winner = player;
                return player;
            }

        return 0;
    }
};
```

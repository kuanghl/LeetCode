### [[452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/)](https://leetcode.com/problems/queue-reconstruction-by-height/)

There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array `points` where `points[i] = [xstart, xend]` denotes a balloon whose **horizontal diameter** stretches between `xstart` and `xend`. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up **directly vertically** (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with `xstart` and `xend` is **burst** by an arrow shot at `x` if `xstart <= x <= xend`. There is **no limit** to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array `points`, return *the **minimum** number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].
```



**Constraints:**

- ``1 <= points.length <= 105`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `-231 <= xstart < xend <= 231 - 1`

#### Solution

区间问题，一般来说先排序，然后合并（求交或求并）。

#### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMinArrowShots(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        sort(points.begin(), points.end());
        int res = 1;
        vector<int> prev = points[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < points.size(); i++) {
            if (points[i][0] > prev[1]) {
                res++;
                prev = points[i];
            }
            else {
                prev[0] = points[i][0];
                prev[1] = min(prev[1], points[i][1]);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

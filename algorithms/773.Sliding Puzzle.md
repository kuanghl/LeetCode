### [773. Sliding Puzzle](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-puzzle/)

On an `2 x 3` board, there are five tiles labeled from `1` to `5`, and an empty square represented by `0`. A **move** consists of choosing `0` and a 4-directionally adjacent number and swapping it.

The state of the board is solved if and only if the board is `[[1,2,3],[4,5,0]]`.

Given the puzzle board `board`, return *the least number of moves required so that the state of the board is solved*. If it is impossible for the state of the board to be solved, return `-1`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: board = [[1,2,3],[4,0,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Swap the 0 and the 5 in one move.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/29/slide2-grid.jpg)

```
Input: board = [[1,2,3],[5,4,0]]
Output: -1
Explanation: No number of moves will make the board solved.
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/29/slide3-grid.jpg)

```
Input: board = [[4,1,2],[5,0,3]]
Output: 5
Explanation: 5 is the smallest number of moves that solves the board.
An example path:
After move 0: [[4,1,2],[5,0,3]]
After move 1: [[4,1,2],[0,5,3]]
After move 2: [[0,1,2],[4,5,3]]
After move 3: [[1,0,2],[4,5,3]]
After move 4: [[1,2,0],[4,5,3]]
After move 5: [[1,2,3],[4,5,0]]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `board.length == 2`
- `board[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= board[i][j] <= 5`
- Each value `board[i][j]` is **unique**.

#### 解析

BFS+state compression.

#### 代码

```c++
// BFS
class Solution {
    string convert(vector<vector<int>>& board) {
        string s;
        for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                s += to_string(board[i][j]);
            }
        }
        return s;
    }

                    int nr = row + next[i];
                    int nc = col + next[i+1];
                    if (nr >= 0 && nr < 2 && nc >= 0 && nc < 3) {
                        string tmp = cur;
                        swap(tmp[nr*3 + nc], tmp[index]);
                        
                        if (visited.insert(tmp).second) {
                            q.push(tmp);
                        }
                    }
                }

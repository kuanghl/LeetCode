### 2781. Length of the Longest Valid Substring

YoYou are given a string `word` and an array of strings `forbidden`.

A string is called **valid** if none of its substrings are present in `forbidden`.

Return *the length of the **longest valid substring** of the string* `word`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string, possibly empty.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: word = "cbaaaabc", forbidden = ["aaa","cb"]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 9 valid substrings in word: "c", "b", "a", "ba", "aa", "bc", "baa", "aab", and "aabc". The length of the longest valid substring is 4. 
It can be shown that all other substrings contain either "aaa" or "cb" as a substring. 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: word = "leetcode", forbidden = ["de","le","e"]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 11 valid substrings in word: "l", "t", "c", "o", "d", "tc", "co", "od", "tco", "cod", and "tcod". The length of the longest valid substring is 4.
It can be shown that all other substrings contain either "de", "le", or "e" as a substring. *Constraints:**
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= word.length <= 105`
- `word` consists only of lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= forbidden.length <= 105`
- `1 <= forbidden[i].length <= 10`
- `forbidden[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.

#### Solution

Sliding Windows.

The key to this problem is to realize the following condition:

```
1 <= forbidden[i].length <= 10
```

In words, this means the length of a forbidden substring will be no more than 10 characters.

This means if we know the length of the longest substring without forbidden words starting at index `i + 1`, we need to check at most 10 new substrings to calculate the longest substring starting at index `i`.

In the picture above, for the new character `c` that we start considering (moving from index `i + 1` to index `i`), the new substrings that we need to consider are `c`, `cb`, `cba`, `cbaa`, `cbaaa`.

To find the length of the longest substring starting at `i`, not including any substrings in `forbidden`, we can use a variable `k`.

- If we continuously increase `k` and realize that the substring in range `[i, i + k]` (inclusive) is in `forbidden` (for the first time, as we increase `k`), then we know that the substring in `[i, i + k - 1]` (of length `k`) is "valid".
- If we do **NOT** encounter a substring in `forbidden` as we increase `k`, the solution is `1 + (the solution for i + 1)`.
- However, we don't need to keep track of this number; we can simply keep track of the right most index of the "valid" substring.

#### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestValidSubstring(string word, vector<string>& forbidden) {
        unordered_set<string> tables(forbidden.begin(), forbidden.end());
        int right = word.size() - 1;
        int res = 0;
        for (int left = word.size(); left >= 0; left--) {
            for (int k = left; k < min(left + 10, right + 1); k++) {
                if (tables.find(word.substr(left, k-left+1))!=tables.end()) {
                    right = k-1;
                    break;
                }
            }
            res = max(res, right - left + 1);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

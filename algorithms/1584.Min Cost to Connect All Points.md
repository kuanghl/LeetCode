### [1584. Min Cost to Connect All Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-to-connect-all-points/)

You are given an array `points` representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`.

The cost of connecting two points `[xi, yi]` and `[xj, yj]` is the **manhattan distance** between them: `|xi - xj| + |yi - yj|`, where `|val|` denotes the absolute value of `val`.

Return *the minimum cost to make all points connected.* All points are connected if there is **exactly one** simple path between any two points.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]
Output: 20
Explanation: 

We can connect the points as shown above to get the minimum cost of 20.
Notice that there is a unique path between every pair of points.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[3,12],[-2,5],[-4,1]]
Output: 18
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= points.length <= 1000`
- `-106 <= xi, yi <= 106`
- All pairs `(xi, yi)` are distinct.

#### Solution

prime algorithm

#### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCostConnectPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        int n = points.size();
        vector<bool> visited(n);
        int ans = 0, index = 0;
        int cnt = 0;
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, std::greater<pair<int, int>>> q;
        while (++cnt < n) {
            visited[index] = true;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                q.push({(abs(points[i][0] - points[index][0])
                 + abs(points[i][1] - points[index][1])), i});
            }
            while (visited[q.top().second]) q.pop();
            ans += q.top().first;
            index = q.top().second;
            q.pop();
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### [2448. Minimum Cost to Make Array Equal](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-make-array-equal/)

You are given two **0-indexed** arrays `nums` and `cost` consisting each of `n` **positive** integers.

You can do the following operation **any** number of times:

- Increase or decrease **any** element of the array `nums` by `1`.

The cost of doing one operation on the `ith` element is `cost[i]`.

Return *the **minimum** total cost such that all the elements of the array* `nums` *become **equal***.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,2], cost = [2,3,1,14]
Output: 8
Explanation: We can make all the elements equal to 2 in the following way:
- Increase the 0th element one time. The cost is 2.
- Decrease the 1st element one time. The cost is 3.
- Decrease the 2nd element three times. The cost is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
The total cost is 2 + 3 + 3 = 8.
It can be shown that we cannot make the array equal with a smaller cost.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2], cost = [4,2,8,1,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: All the elements are already equal, so no operations are needed.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length == cost.length`
- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i], cost[i] <= 106`
- Test cases are generated in a way that the output doesn't exceed 253-1

#### 解析

10^5数据范围，NlogN可以过，此题本质上是要选定一个值使得其他的值和它相等的代价最小。用二分查找，从nums的最小值和最大值范围中查找，每次计算mid和mid+1的cost，根据大小改变left/right.

#### 代码

```c++
class Solution {
    long long CalCost(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& cost, int x) {
        long long res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            res += (long long)abs(nums[i] - x) * cost[i];
        }
        return res;
    }
public:
    long long minCost(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& cost) {
        int n = cost.size();
        int left = INT_MAX, right = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            left = min(left, nums[i]);
            right = max(right, nums[i]);
        }
        long long res = 0;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            long long res1 = CalCost(nums, cost, mid);
            long long res2 = CalCost(nums, cost, mid+1);
            res = min(res1, res2);
            if (res1 < res2) {
                right = mid;
            }
            else {
                left = mid+1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

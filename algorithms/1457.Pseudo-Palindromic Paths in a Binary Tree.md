### [1457. Pseudo-Palindromic Paths in a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/pseudo-palindromic-paths-in-a-binary-tree/)

Given a binary tree where node values are digits from 1 to 9. A path in the binary tree is said to be **pseudo-palindromic** if at least one permutation of the node values in the path is a palindrome.

*Return the number of **pseudo-palindromic** paths going from the root node to leaf nodes.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [2,3,1,3,1,null,1]
Output: 2 
Explanation: The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are three paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the red path [2,3,3], the green path [2,1,1], and the path [2,3,1]. Among these paths only red path and green path are pseudo-palindromic paths since the red path [2,3,3] can be rearranged in [3,2,3] (palindrome) and the green path [2,1,1] can be rearranged in [1,2,1] (palindrome).
```

**Example 2:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/07/palindromic_paths_2.png)**

```
Input: root = [2,1,1,1,3,null,null,null,null,null,1]
Output: 1 
Explanation: The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are three paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the green path [2,1,1], the path [2,1,3,1], and the path [2,1]. Among these paths only the green path is pseudo-palindromic since [2,1,1] can be rearranged in [1,2,1] (palindrome).
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [9]
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 105]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 9`

#### Solution

Recursion

When reaching the leaf, judge if the path match the condition: all value are pairs except one or zero

Time complexity: O(n)

#### Code

```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */

        if (!root) return;
        records[root->val-1]++;
        if (!root->left && !root->right) {
            int cnt = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < records.size(); i++) {
                if (records[i] & 1) cnt++;
            }
            if (cnt <= 1) ans++;
            records[root->val-1]--;
            return;
        }
        pseudoPalindromicPaths(root->left, records);
        pseudoPalindromicPaths(root->right, records);
        records[root->val-1]--;
    }
    int pseudoPalindromicPaths (TreeNode* root) {
        ans = 0;
        vector<int> records(9, 0);
        pseudoPalindromicPaths (root, records);
        return ans;
    }
};

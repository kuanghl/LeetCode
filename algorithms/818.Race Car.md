### [818. Race Car](https://leetcode.com/problems/race-car/)

Your car starts at position `0` and speed `+1` on an infinite number line. Your car can go into negative positions. Your car drives automatically according to a sequence of instructions `'A'` (accelerate) and `'R'` (reverse):

- When you get an instruction

   

  ```
  'A'
  ```

  , your car does the following:

  - `position += speed`
  - `speed *= 2`

- When you get an instruction

   

  ```
  'R'
  ```

  , your car does the following:

  - If your speed is positive then `speed = -1`
  - otherwise `speed = 1`

  Your position stays the same.

For example, after commands `"AAR"`, your car goes to positions `0 --> 1 --> 3 --> 3`, and your speed goes to `1 --> 2 --> 4 --> -1`.

Given a target position `target`, return *the length of the shortest sequence of instructions to get there*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The shortest instruction sequence is "AA".
Your position goes from 0 --> 1 --> 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: target = 6
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The shortest instruction sequence is "AAARA".
Your position goes from 0 --> 1 --> 3 --> 7 --> 7 --> 6.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= target <= 104`

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: secret = "acckzz", words = ["acckzz","ccbazz","eiowzz","abcczz"], allowedGuesses = 10
Output: You guessed the secret word correctly.
Explanation:
master.guess("aaaaaa") returns -1, because "aaaaaa" is not in wordlist.
master.guess("acckzz") returns 6, because "acckzz" is secret and has all 6 matches.
master.guess("ccbazz") returns 3, because "ccbazz" has 3 matches.
master.guess("eiowzz") returns 2, because "eiowzz" has 2 matches.
master.guess("abcczz") returns 4, because "abcczz" has 4 matches.
We made 5 calls to master.guess, and one of them was the secret, so we pass the test case.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: secret = "hamada", words = ["hamada","khaled"], allowedGuesses = 10
Output: You guessed the secret word correctly.
Explanation: Since there are two words, you can guess both.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
- `words[i].length == 6`
- `words[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
- All the strings of `wordlist` are **unique**.
- `secret` exists in `words`.
- `10 <= allowedGuesses <= 30`

        int len = -1;
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            len++;
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                auto [pos, speed] = q.front(); q.pop();

                }
                if (abs(pos) > 2 * target) continue;
                // A: speed up
                if (visited.insert({pos + speed, speed*2}).second) {
                    q.push({pos + speed, speed*2});
                }
                
                // R: reverse
                int nx = speed > 0 ? -1 : 1;
                if (visited.insert({pos, nx}).second) {
                    q.push({pos, nx});
                }
            }
        }
        return len;
    }

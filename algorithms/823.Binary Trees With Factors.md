### [823. Binary Trees With Factors](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-trees-with-factors/)

Given an array of unique integers, `arr`, where each integer `arr[i]` is strictly greater than `1`.

We make a binary tree using these integers, and each number may be used for any number of times. Each non-leaf node's value should be equal to the product of the values of its children.

Return *the number of binary trees we can make*. The answer may be too large so return the answer **modulo** `109 + 7`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [2,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can make these trees: [2], [4], [4, 2, 2]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [2,4,5,10]
Output: 7
Explanation: We can make these trees: [2], [4], [5], [10], [4, 2, 2], [10, 2, 5], [10, 5, 2].
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `2 <= arr[i] <= 109`
- All the values of `arr` are **unique**.



#### Solution

first sort arr

dp[i] the number of binary tree we can make for arr[i] as root

dp[i]+=(dp[j]+dp[m]) if (arr[j]*arr[m] == arr[i] and j != m)

j from 0 to i-1, m from i-1 to 0, double pointer

init: dp[i] = 1

Time complexity:O(n^2)

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int numFactoredBinaryTrees(vector<int>& arr) {
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        int n = arr.size();
        vector<long long> dp(n, 1);
        int MOD = 1e9+7;
        long long sum = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int start = 0, end = i-1;
            while (start <= end) {
                long long cur = (long long)arr[start]*(long long)arr[end];
                if (cur == arr[i]) {
                    long long total = dp[start]*dp[end]%MOD;
                    if (start != end) {
                        total = (total*2)%MOD;
                    }
                    dp[i] = (dp[i] + total)%MOD;
                    start++;
                }
                else if (cur > arr[i]) {
                    end--;
                }
                else start++;
            }
            sum = (sum + dp[i]) % MOD;
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```

### [1335. Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difficulty-of-a-job-schedule/)

You want to schedule a list of jobs in `d` days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the `ith` job, you have to finish all the jobs `j` where `0 <= j < i`).

You have to finish **at least** one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the `d` days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done on that day.

You are given an integer array `jobDifficulty` and an integer `d`. The difficulty of the `ith` job is `jobDifficulty[i]`.

Return *the minimum difficulty of a job schedule*. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return `-1`.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/16/untitled.png)

```
Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.
Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.
The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4
Output: -1
Explanation: If you finish a job per day you will still have a free day. you cannot find a schedule for the given jobs.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The schedule is one job per day. total difficulty will be 3.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= jobDifficulty.length <= 300`
- `0 <= jobDifficulty[i] <= 1000`
- `1 <= d <= 10`

```
// dp[i][j] using i days to finish [0, j] jobs
// dp[i][j] = min[k from i to j](dp[i-1][k-1]+max[t from k to j](jobs[t])) 
// dp[1][j] = max[t from 0 to j](jobs[t])
```

$$
f[i][j]= \min_{i \leq k \leq j}\left\{f[i−1][k−1]+ \min_{k \leq p \leq j}a[p]\right\}
$$

$$
f[0][j]= \min_{0 \leq p \leq j}a[p]
$$



#### 代码

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minDifficulty(vector<int>& jobDifficulty, int d) {
        int n = jobDifficulty.size();
        if (n < d) return -1;
        vector<vector<int>> dp(d+1, vector<int>(n, 0));
        dp[1][0] = jobDifficulty[0];
        int mx = jobDifficulty[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            mx = max(mx, jobDifficulty[i]);
            dp[1][i] = mx;
        }
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= d; i++) {
            for (int j = n-1; j >= i-1; j--) {
                mx = 0;
                dp[i][j] = INT_MAX;
                for (int k = j; k >= i-1; k--) {
                    mx = max(mx, jobDifficulty[k]);
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][k-1] + mx);
                }
            }

        }
        return dp[d][n-1];
    }
};
```

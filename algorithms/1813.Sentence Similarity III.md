### [1813. Sentence Similarity III](https://leetcode.com/problems/sentence-similarity-iii/)

You are given two strings `sentence1` and `sentence2`, each representing a **sentence** composed of words. A sentence is a list of **words** that are separated by a **single** space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of only uppercase and lowercase English characters.

Two sentences `s1` and `s2` are considered **similar** if it is possible to insert an arbitrary sentence (*possibly empty*) inside one of these sentences such that the two sentences become equal. **Note** that the inserted sentence must be separated from existing words by spaces.

For example,

- `s1 = "Hello Jane"` and `s2 = "Hello my name is Jane"` can be made equal by inserting `"my name is"` between `"Hello"` and `"Jane"` in s1.
- `s1 = "Frog cool"` and `s2 = "Frogs are cool"` are **not** similar, since although there is a sentence `"s are"` inserted into `s1`, it is not separated from `"Frog"` by a space.

Given two sentences `sentence1` and `sentence2`, return **true** if `sentence1` and `sentence2` are **similar**. Otherwise, return **false**.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** sentence1 = "My name is Haley", sentence2 = "My Haley"

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

`sentence2` can be turned to `sentence1` by inserting "name is" between "My" and "Haley".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** sentence1 = "of", sentence2 = "A lot of words"

**Output:** false

**Explanation:**

No single sentence can be inserted inside one of the sentences to make it equal to the other.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** sentence1 = "Eating right now", sentence2 = "Eating"

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

`sentence2` can be turned to `sentence1` by inserting "right now" at the end of the sentence.

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= sentence1.length, sentence2.length <= 100`
- `sentence1` and `sentence2` consist of lowercase and uppercase English letters and spaces.
- The words in `sentence1` and `sentence2` are separated by a single space.

#### Solution

two vectors

compare from start and end

if the start match+end match >= shorter sentence size, meaning cover the sentence, true

other wise false

time complexity: O(n)

space complexity: O(n)

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    void splitStr(string& s, vector<string>& vec) {
        stringstream ss(s);
        int idx = 0;
        string tmp;
        while(getline(ss, tmp, ' ')) {
            vec.push_back(tmp);
            idx++;
        }
    }
    bool areSentencesSimilar(string sentence1, string sentence2) {
        vector<string> v1, v2;
        splitStr(sentence1, v1);
        splitStr(sentence2, v2);
        if (v1.size() > v2.size()) swap(v1, v2);
        int start = 0, end = 0;
        int n1 = v1.size(), n2 = v2.size();
        // compare from start
        while (start < n1 && v1[start] == v2[start]) start++;

        // compare from end
        while (end < n1 && v1[n1-end-1] == v2[n2-end-1]) end++;

        // cover the shorter sentence
        if (start + end >= n1) return true;

        
        return false;
    }
};

### [1344. Angle Between Hands of a Clock](https://leetcode.com/problems/angle-between-hands-of-a-clock/)

Given two numbers, `hour` and `minutes`, return *the smaller angle (in degrees) formed between the* `hour` *and the* `minute` *hand*.

Answers within `10-5` of the actual value will be accepted as correct.

```
Input: hour = 3, minutes = 15
Output: 7.5
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= hour <= 12`
- `0 <= minutes <= 59`

#### Solution

math calculation

Time&Space Complexity: O(1)

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {
        double diff = minutes/60.0*30.0;
        double hour_degree = hour/12.0 * 360.0+diff;
        double minutes_degree = minutes/60.0*360.0;
        double difference = abs(hour_degree-minutes_degree);
        double res = min(difference, abs(360.0-difference));
        return res;
    }
};
```

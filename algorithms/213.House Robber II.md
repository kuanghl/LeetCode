### 213.House Robber II

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
             because they are adjacent houses.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

#### 解析

之前的方式是首尾不相邻，现在是首尾相邻，相当于分成两种情况，若共n个house，则分成0~n-2和2~n-1，这两种情况仍然用之前的方式处理，取最大值就行。

#### 代码

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if(n<2) return n>0?nums[0]:0;
        return max(robber(nums, 0, n-2),robber(nums,1,n-1));
    }
    int robber(const vector<int>& nums, int begin,int end)
    {
        int n1 = 0,n2 = 0;
        for(int i=begin;i<=end&&i<nums.size();++i)
        {
            if(i%2==0)
                n2 = max(n1, n2+nums[i]);
            else
                n1 = max(n2, n1+nums[i]);
        }
        return max(n1,n2);
    }
};
```

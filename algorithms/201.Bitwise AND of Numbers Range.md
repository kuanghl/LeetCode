### 201.Bitwise AND of Numbers Range

Given a range [m, n] where 0 <= m <= n <= 2147483647, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [5,7]
Output: 4

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [0,1]
Output: 0
```

#### 解析

The hardest part of this problem is to find the regular pattern.
For example, for number `26 to 30`
Their binary form are:
`11010`
`11011`
`11100`　　
`11101`　　
`11110`

Because we are trying to find bitwise AND, so if any bit there are at least one `0` and one `1`, it always `0`. In this case, it is `11000`.
So we are go to cut all these bit that they are different. In this case we cut the right `3` bit.

#### 代码

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right) {
        int num = 0;
        while (left != right) {
            left >>= 1;
            right >>= 1;
            num++;
        }
        return left << num;
    }
};
```

### [1573. Number of Ways to Split a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-split-a-string/)

Given a binary string `s`, you can split `s` into 3 **non-empty** strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` where `s1 + s2 + s3 = s`.

Return the number of ways `s` can be split such that the number of ones is the same in `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`. Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "10101"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are four ways to split s in 3 parts where each part contain the same number of letters '1'.
"1|010|1"
"1|01|01"
"10|10|1"
"10|1|01"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "1001"
Output: 0
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "0000"
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to split s in 3 parts.
"0|0|00"
"0|00|0"
"00|0|0"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

#### 解析

For all zero, special solving, for ones, split to three parts, first  part changeable length  = next part first 1's index - first part last 1's index. The second part is silimiar. The result = first  part changeable length * second  part changeable length. Because last part is defined by first two parts, so no need to multiple it.

#### 代码

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int numWays(string s) {
        int ones = 0;
        for (auto& ch : s) {
            if (ch == '1') ones++;
        }
        if (ones%3 != 0) return 0;
        long long res = 0;
        if (ones == 0) {
            int n = s.size();
            res = n-2;
            for (long i = n-3; i >= 1; i--) {
                res = (res + i) % (1000000007);
            }
            return res;
        }
        int cnt = ones/3;
        vector<long> records(2, 0);
        int i = 0;
        int cur = 0;
        int left = -1;
        while (i < s.size() && cur <= 1) {
            if (cnt > 0 && s[i]=='1') {
                cnt--;
                left = i;
            }
            i++;
            if (cnt == 0) {
                while (i < s.size() && s[i] != '1') {
                    i++;
                }
                records[cur++] = i - left;
                left = -1;
                cnt = ones/3;
            }
        }
        
        res = records[0] * records[1] % 1000000007;
        return res;
    }
};

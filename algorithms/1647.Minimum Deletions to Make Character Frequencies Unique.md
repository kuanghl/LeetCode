### [1647. Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-character-frequencies-unique/)

A string `s` is called **good** if there are no two different characters in `s` that have the same **frequency**.

Given a string `s`, return *the **minimum** number of characters you need to delete to make* `s` ***good**.*

The **frequency** of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string. For example, in the string `"aab"`, the **frequency** of `'a'` is `2`, while the **frequency** of `'b'` is `1`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aab"
Output: 0
Explanation: s is already good.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aaabbbcc"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can delete two 'b's resulting in the good string "aaabcc".
Another way it to delete one 'b' and one 'c' resulting in the good string "aaabbc".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "ceabaacb"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can delete both 'c's resulting in the good string "eabaab".
Note that we only care about characters that are still in the string at the end (i.e. frequency of 0 is ignored).
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

#### Solution

First, convert s to vector<int>, this problem is converted into integer array which must does not has repeated element.

So we need erase repeated integers, we can use a stack to store integers which are not in array. When we encounter a repeated integer, we can calculate the diff of cur index and stack.top() to get the number of deletion.

#### Code

```cpp
lass Solution {
public:
    int minDeletions(string s) {
        vector<int> nums;
        vector<int> cnts(26, 0);
        for (auto& ch : s) {
            cnts[ch-'a']++;
        }
        for (auto& cnt : cnts) {
            if (cnt > 0)
                nums.push_back(cnt);
        }
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        stack<int> st;
        int empty = 1;
        unordered_set<int> records;
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (i-1 >= 0 && nums[i] > nums[i-1]) empty++;
            while (nums[i] != empty) {
                st.push(empty++);
            }
            int cur = nums[i];
            if (!records.insert(cur).second) {
                if (!st.empty()) {
                    res += cur - st.top();
                    st.pop();
                }
                else {
                    res += cur;
                }
            }
            
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

### [2385. Amount of Time for Binary Tree to Be Infected](https://leetcode.com/problems/amount-of-time-for-binary-tree-to-be-infected/)

You are given the `root` of a binary tree with **unique** values, and an integer `start`. At minute `0`, an **infection** starts from the node with value `start`.

Each minute, a node becomes infected if:

- The node is currently uninfected.
- The node is adjacent to an infected node.

Return *the number of minutes needed for the entire tree to be infected.*

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/06/25/image-20220625231744-1.png)

```
Input: root = [1,5,3,null,4,10,6,9,2], start = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The following nodes are infected during:
- Minute 0: Node 3
- Minute 1: Nodes 1, 10 and 6
- Minute 2: Node 5
- Minute 3: Node 4
- Minute 4: Nodes 9 and 2
It takes 4 minutes for the whole tree to be infected so we return 4.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/06/25/image-20220625231812-2.png)

```
Input: root = [1], start = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: At minute 0, the only node in the tree is infected so we return 0.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 105]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 105`
- Each node has a **unique** value.
- A node with a value of `start` exists in the tree.

#### Solution

recursion.

 start_path: path_len include start

 max_path: path_len which is max

 Time Complexity:O(n)

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int ans;
    void amountOfTime(TreeNode* node, int start, 
        int& start_path, int& max_path) {
        if (!node) return;
        int left_start_path = 0, left_max_path = 0;
        amountOfTime(node->left, start, left_start_path, left_max_path);
        int right_start_path = 0, right_max_path = 0;
        amountOfTime(node->right, start, right_start_path, right_max_path);
        if (node->val == start) {
            start_path = 1;
        }
        // start in left
        if (left_start_path > 0) {
            ans = max(ans, right_max_path+ left_start_path);
            start_path = left_start_path+1;
        }
        else if (right_start_path > 0) {
            ans = max(ans, left_max_path+ right_start_path);
            start_path = right_start_path+1;
        }
        else {
            max_path = max(left_max_path, right_max_path) + 1;
            ans = max(ans, max_path-1);
        }
    }
    int amountOfTime(TreeNode* root, int start) {
        ans = 0;
        int start_path = 0, max_path = 0;
        amountOfTime(root, start, start_path, max_path);
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### [2858. Minimum Edge Reversals So Every Node Is Reachable](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-edge-reversals-so-every-node-is-reachable/)

There is a **simple directed graph** with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. The graph would form a **tree** if its edges were bi-directional.

You are given an integer `n` and a **2D** integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` represents a **directed edge** going from node `ui` to node `vi`.

An **edge reversal** changes the direction of an edge, i.e., a directed edge going from node `ui` to node `vi` becomes a directed edge going from node `vi` to node `ui`.

For every node `i` in the range `[0, n - 1]`, your task is to **independently** calculate the **minimum** number of **edge reversals** required so it is possible to reach any other node starting from node `i` through a **sequence** of **directed edges**.

Return *an integer array* `answer`*, where* `answer[i]` *is the* ***minimum** number of **edge reversals** required so it is possible to reach any other node starting from node* `i` *through a **sequence** of **directed edges**.*

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/08/26/image-20230826221104-3.png)

```
Input: n = 4, edges = [[2,0],[2,1],[1,3]]
Output: [1,1,0,2]
Explanation: The image above shows the graph formed by the edges.
For node 0: after reversing the edge [2,0], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 0.
So, answer[0] = 1.
For node 1: after reversing the edge [2,1], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 1.
So, answer[1] = 1.
For node 2: it is already possible to reach any other node starting from node 2.
So, answer[2] = 0.
For node 3: after reversing the edges [1,3] and [2,1], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 3.
So, answer[3] = 2.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/08/26/image-20230826225541-2.png)

```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[1,2],[2,0]]
Output: [2,0,1]
Explanation: The image above shows the graph formed by the edges.
For node 0: after reversing the edges [2,0] and [1,2], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 0.
So, answer[0] = 2.
For node 1: it is already possible to reach any other node starting from node 1.
So, answer[1] = 0.
For node 2: after reversing the edge [1, 2], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 2.
So, answer[2] = 1.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 105`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ui == edges[i][0] < n`
- `0 <= vi == edges[i][1] < n`
- `ui != vi`
- The input is generated such that if the edges were bi-directional, the graph would be a tree.

#### Solution

First creating a graph stores directed graph, then creating a adjacency list (named tree) to store node's neighbors, and record reversals number of node on the side of neighbor's.

For every node, DFS, and update Node if not set.

Time complexity: O(n)

#### Code

```c++
struct Node {
    int name;
    int cnt; // cnt of reversals
    Node(int n, int c):name(n), cnt(c) {}
};
class Solution {
private:
    int DFS(int name, unordered_map<int, vector<Node>>& tree, 
        unordered_map<int, unordered_set<int>>& graph, vector<bool>& visited) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < tree[name].size(); i++) { 
            auto& next = tree[name][i];
            if (visited[next.name]) continue;
            // cached
            if (next.cnt >= 0) {
                res += next.cnt;
                continue;
            }
            int res1 = 0;
            visited[next.name] = true;
            if (graph[name].find(next.name) == graph[name].end()) {
                res1 += 1;
            }
            res1 += DFS(next.name, tree, graph, visited);
            next.cnt = res1;
            res += res1;
        }
        return res;
    }
public:
    vector<int> minEdgeReversals(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        unordered_map<int, unordered_set<int>> graph;
        unordered_map<int, vector<Node>> tree;
        for (auto& edge : edges) {
            graph[edge[0]].insert(edge[1]);
            tree[edge[0]].push_back(Node(edge[1], -1));
            tree[edge[1]].push_back(Node(edge[0], -1));
        }
        vector<int> res(n, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            vector<bool> visited(n, false);
            visited[i] = true;
            DFS(i, tree, graph, visited);
            for (auto& next: tree[i]) {
                res[i] += next.cnt;
            }
        }
        return res;

    }
};

### [2555. Maximize Win From Two Segments](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-win-from-two-segments/)

There are some prizes on the **X-axis**. You are given an integer array `prizePositions` that is **sorted in non-decreasing order**, where `prizePositions[i]` is the position of the `ith` prize. There could be different prizes at the same position on the line. You are also given an integer `k`.

You are allowed to select two segments with integer endpoints. The length of each segment must be `k`. You will collect all prizes whose position falls within at least one of the two selected segments (including the endpoints of the segments). The two selected segments may intersect.

- For example if `k = 2`, you can choose segments `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]`, and you will win any prize i that satisfies `1 <= prizePositions[i] <= 3` or `2 <= prizePositions[i] <= 4`.

Return *the **maximum** number of prizes you can win if you choose the two segments optimally*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prizePositions = [1,1,2,2,3,3,5], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: In this example, you can win all 7 prizes by selecting two segments [1, 3] and [3, 5].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prizePositions = [1,2,3,4], k = 0
Output: 2
Explanation: For this example, one choice for the segments is [3, 3] and [4, 4], and you will be able to get 2 prizes. 
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prizePositions.length <= 105`
- `1 <= prizePositions[i] <= 109`
- `0 <= k <= 109 `
- `prizePositions` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

#### Solution

Two pointers+dp

dp[i] the max win at i+1 index for first segment.

Left points to the left of segment two, right points to the right of segment two.

When pos[right] - pos[left] > k, left need to move.

so `ans = max(ans, right - left+1 + dp[left]);`

`dp[right+1] = max(dp[right], right - left+1);`

Time complexity: O(n)

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maximizeWin(vector<int>& prizePositions, int k) {
        int left = 0, right = 0, n = prizePositions.size();
        vector<int> dp(n+1, 0);
        int ans = 0;
        for (; right < n; right++) {
            while (prizePositions[right] - prizePositions[left] > k) left++;
            ans = max(ans, right - left+1 + dp[left]);
            dp[right+1] = max(dp[right], right - left+1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

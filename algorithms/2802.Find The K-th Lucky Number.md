### [2802. Find The K-th Lucky Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-k-th-lucky-number/)

We know that `4` and `7` are **lucky** digits. Also, a number is called **lucky** if it contains **only** lucky digits.

You are given an integer `k`, return *the* `kth` *lucky number represented as a **string**.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: k = 4
Output: "47"
Explanation: The first lucky number is 4, the second one is 7, the third one is 44 and the fourth one is 47.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: k = 10
Output: "477"
Explanation: Here are lucky numbers sorted in increasing order:
4, 7, 44, 47, 74, 77, 444, 447, 474, 477. So the 10th lucky number is 477.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: k = 1000
Output: "777747447"
Explanation: It can be shown that the 1000th lucky number is 777747447.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= 109`

#### Solution

Mapping:

2->10->4

3->11->7

4->100->44

5->101->47

So it's from k+1.

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string kthLuckyNumber(int k) {
        int m = k+1;
        string res;
        while (m) {
            int tmp = m%10;
            if (m & 1) {
                res += '7';
            }
            else res += '4';
            m >>= 1;
        }
        res.pop_back();
        reverse(res.begin(), res.end());
        return res;
    }
};
```

### [444. Sequence Reconstruction](https://leetcode.com/problems/sequence-reconstruction/)

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` where `nums` is a permutation of the integers in the range `[1, n]`. You are also given a 2D integer array `sequences` where `sequences[i]` is a subsequence of `nums`.

Check if `nums` is the shortest possible and the only **supersequence**. The shortest **supersequence** is a sequence **with the shortest length** and has all `sequences[i]` as subsequences. There could be multiple valid **supersequences** for the given array `sequences`.

- For example, for `sequences = [[1,2],[1,3]]`, there are two shortest **supersequences**, `[1,2,3]` and `[1,3,2]`.
- While for `sequences = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,2,3]]`, the only shortest **supersequence** possible is `[1,2,3]`. `[1,2,3,4]` is a possible supersequence but not the shortest.

Return `true` *if* `nums` *is the only shortest **supersequence** for* `sequences`*, or* `false` *otherwise*.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], sequences = [[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are two possible supersequences: [1,2,3] and [1,3,2].
The sequence [1,2] is a subsequence of both: [1,2,3] and [1,3,2].
The sequence [1,3] is a subsequence of both: [1,2,3] and [1,3,2].
Since nums is not the only shortest supersequence, we return false.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], sequences = [[1,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: The shortest possible supersequence is [1,2].
The sequence [1,2] is a subsequence of it: [1,2].
Since nums is not the shortest supersequence, we return false.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], sequences = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: true
Explanation: The shortest possible supersequence is [1,2,3].
The sequence [1,2] is a subsequence of it: [1,2,3].
The sequence [1,3] is a subsequence of it: [1,2,3].
The sequence [2,3] is a subsequence of it: [1,2,3].
Since nums is the only shortest supersequence, we return true.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 104`
- `nums` is a permutation of all the integers in the range `[1, n]`.
- `1 <= sequences.length <= 104`
- `1 <= sequences[i].length <= 104`
- `1 <= sum(sequences[i].length) <= 105`
- `1 <= sequences[i][j] <= n`
- All the arrays of `sequences` are **unique**.
- `sequences[i]` is a subsequence of `nums`.

topological sort.

#### Code

```c++

        int n = nums.size();

        vector<int> indegree(n+1, 0);

            for (int i = 0; i < sequence.size()-1; i++) {
                m[sequence[i]].push_back(sequence[i+1]);
                indegree[sequence[i+1]]++;
            }
        }
        int cnt = 0;
        queue<int> q;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {

                if (cnt > 0) return false;
                cnt++;

        }

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int cur = q.front(); q.pop();
            new_nums.push_back(cur);
            cnt = 0;
            for (auto& next : m[cur]) {
                indegree[next]--;
                if (indegree[next] == 0) {
                    q.push(next);
                    cnt++;
                    if (cnt > 1) return false;
                }
            }
        }
        if (new_nums.size() != n) return false;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (new_nums[i] != nums[i]) return false;
        }
        return true;

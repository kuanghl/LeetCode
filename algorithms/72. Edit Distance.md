### 72. Edit Distance

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return *the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`*.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

- Insert a character
- Delete a character
- Replace a character

**Example 1:**

```
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')**Example 2:**
```

```
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```

### Solution

Dynamic programming.

Set `dp[i][j]`, i is length of word1, j is length of word2, `dp[i][j]` means the minimum edit distance from word1 to word2.

The function is:

If S1 = "abc", S2 = "dec", then their editing distance is d[3, 3] = 2, observe that the last characters of the two strings are the same, that is to say, S1(3) = S2(3) does not need any transformation, so S1 = "abc", S2 = "dec" <= > S1' = "ab", S2' = "de", that is, when S1[i] = S[j] When , d[i, j] = d[i-1, j -1]. Get the formula: d[i, j] = d[i - 1, j - 1] (S1[i] = S2[j])

**Insert** the character "f" at the end of the S1 string. At this time, S1 = "abcf", S2 = "def". At this time, it is the case of S1[i] = S2[j]. The edit distance from S1 to S2 is d [4, 3] = d[3, 2]. So d[i, j]=d[i, j - 1] + 1. (+1 because S1 added "f")

**Delete** the last letter of S1, at this time the edit distance is equal to 1 (delete operation) + edit distance from S1 to S2 after removing the last letter d [i - 1][j] + 1

**Replace** the last letter of S1 with the last letter of S. At this time, the edit distance is equal to 1 (replacement operation) + the edit distance between S1 and S2 after removing the last letter. is d[i - 1][j - 1] + 1

#### Code

```c++
// space O(n^2)
class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(word1.size() + 1, vector<int>(word2.size() + 1, 0));
        for (int i = 1; i <= word1.size(); i++) {
            dp[i][0] = i;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i <= word2.size(); i++) {
            dp[0][i] = i;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i <= word1.size(); i++)
            for (int j = 1; j <= word2.size(); j++) {
                if (word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1];
                }
                else {
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + min(min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i][j-1]), dp[i-1][j]);
                }
        }
        return dp[word1.size()][word2.size()];
    }
};
```

```C++
// space O(n)
// bacause only need three old values
// need a tmp to store the dp[i][j-1]
class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        vector<int> dp(word2.size() + 1, 0);
        for (int i = 1; i <= word2.size(); i++) {
            dp[i] = i;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i <= word1.size(); i++){
            int old = dp[0];
            dp[0] = i;
            for (int j = 1; j <= word2.size(); j++) {
                int tmp = dp[j];
                if (word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]) {
                    dp[j] = old;
                }
                else {
                    dp[j] = 1 + min(min(dp[j-1], dp[j]), old);
                }
                old = tmp;
            }
        }
            
        return dp[word2.size()];
    }
};
```

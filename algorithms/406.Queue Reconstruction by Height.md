### [406. Queue Reconstruction by Height](https://leetcode.com/problems/queue-reconstruction-by-height/)

You are given an array of people, `people`, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each `people[i] = [hi, ki]` represents the `ith` person of height `hi` with **exactly** `ki` other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to `hi`.

Reconstruct and return *the queue that is represented by the input array* `people`. The returned queue should be formatted as an array `queue`, where `queue[j] = [hj, kj]` is the attributes of the `jth` person in the queue (`queue[0]` is the person at the front of the queue).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]
Output: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]
Explanation:
Person 0 has height 5 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 1 has height 7 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 2 has height 5 with two persons taller or the same height in front, which is person 0 and 1.
Person 3 has height 6 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Person 4 has height 4 with four people taller or the same height in front, which are people 0, 1, 2, and 3.
Person 5 has height 7 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Hence [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] is the reconstructed queue.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: people = [[6,0],[5,0],[4,0],[3,2],[2,2],[1,4]]
Output: [[4,0],[5,0],[2,2],[3,2],[1,4],[6,0]]
```

**Constraints:**

- ``1 <= people.length <= 2000`
- `0 <= hi <= 106`
- `0 <= ki < people.length`
- It is guaranteed that the queue can be reconstructed.

#### Solution

Greedy.

按照身高排序之后，优先按身高高的people的k来插入，后序插入节点也不会影响前面已经插入的节点，最终按照k的规则完成了队列。

所以在按照身高从大到小排序后：

**局部最优：优先按身高高的people的k来插入。插入操作过后的people满足队列属性**

**全局最优：最后都做完插入操作，整个队列满足题目队列属性**

#### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    static bool cmp(const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
        if (a[0]==b[0]) return a[1] < b[1];
        return a[0] > b[0];
    }
    vector<vector<int>> reconstructQueue(vector<vector<int>>& people) {
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        sort(people.begin(), people.end(), cmp);
        for (auto& item : people) {
            if (res.empty()) {
                res.push_back(item);
                continue;
            }
            res.insert(res.begin() + item[1], item);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

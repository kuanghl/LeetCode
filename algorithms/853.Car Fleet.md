### [853. Car Fleet](https://leetcode.com/problems/car-fleet/)

There are `n` cars going to the same destination along a one-lane road. The destination is `target` miles away.

You are given two integer array `position` and `speed`, both of length `n`, where `position[i]` is the position of the `ith` car and `speed[i]` is the speed of the `ith` car (in miles per hour).

A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it and drive bumper to bumper **at the same speed**. The faster car will **slow down** to match the slower car's speed. The distance between these two cars is ignored (i.e., they are assumed to have the same position).

A **car fleet** is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed. Note that a single car is also a car fleet.

If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will still be considered as one car fleet.

Return *the **number of car fleets** that will arrive at the destination*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12.
The car starting at 0 does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
Note that no other cars meet these fleets before the destination, so the answer is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: target = 10, position = [3], speed = [3]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one car, hence there is only one fleet.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: target = 100, position = [0,2,4], speed = [4,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The cars starting at 0 (speed 4) and 2 (speed 2) become a fleet, meeting each other at 4. The fleet moves at speed 2.
Then, the fleet (speed 2) and the car starting at 4 (speed 1) become one fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == position.length == speed.length`
- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `0 < target <= 106`
- `0 <= position[i] < target`
- All the values of `position` are **unique**.
- `0 < speed[i] <= 106`

#### 解析

```
// first sort by position, position accompany with speed
// then from back to front , calculate the cost time to target
// if time longer than pre, then reset time
```

#### 代码

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int carFleet(int target, vector<int>& position, vector<int>& speed) {
        vector<vector<int>> m;
        int n = position.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            m.push_back({position[i], speed[i]});
        }
        sort(m.begin(), m.end());
        vector<int> final(n, 0);
        int res = 0;
        double time = 0;
        for (int i = n-1; i >= 0; i--) {
            double cur_time = double(target - m[i][0]) / (double)m[i][1];
            if (time == 0 || cur_time > time) {
                if (time > 0 && cur_time > time) {
                    res++;
                }
                time = cur_time;
            }
        }
        res++;
        return res;
    }
};
```

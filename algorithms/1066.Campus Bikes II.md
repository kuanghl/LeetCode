### [1066. Campus Bikes II](https://leetcode.com/problems/campus-bikes-ii/)

On a campus represented as a 2D grid, there are `n` workers and `m` bikes, with `n <= m`. Each worker and bike is a 2D coordinate on this grid.

We assign one unique bike to each worker so that the sum of the **Manhattan distances** between each worker and their assigned bike is minimized.

Return `the minimum possible sum of Manhattan distances between each worker and their assigned bike`.

The **Manhattan distance** between two points `p1` and `p2` is `Manhattan(p1, p2) = |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y - p2.y|`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: workers = [[0,0],[2,1]], bikes = [[1,2],[3,3]]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
We assign bike 0 to worker 0, bike 1 to worker 1. The Manhattan distance of both assignments is 3, so the output is 6.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/03/06/1261_example_2_v2.png)

```
Input: workers = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0]], bikes = [[1,0],[2,2],[2,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
We first assign bike 0 to worker 0, then assign bike 1 to worker 1 or worker 2, bike 2 to worker 2 or worker 1. Both assignments lead to sum of the Manhattan distances as 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: workers = [[0,0],[1,0],[2,0],[3,0],[4,0]], bikes = [[0,999],[1,999],[2,999],[3,999],[4,999]]
Output: 4995
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == workers.length`
- `m == bikes.length`
- `1 <= n <= m <= 10`
- `workers[i].length == 2`
- `bikes[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= workers[i][0], workers[i][1], bikes[i][0], bikes[i][1] < 1000`
- All the workers and the bikes locations are **unique**.

#### Solution

DFS+memory

memory store the minium last distance for the status of workers and bikes

Time complexity:O(n^2)

Space complexity:O(n^2)

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    unordered_map<int, unordered_map<int, int>> memo;
    int DFS(vector<vector<int>>& workers, vector<vector<int>>& bikes, 
        int w, int sum, int w_s, int b_s, vector<bool>& visited, int& ans) {
            if (w == workers.size()) {
                return sum;
            }
            if (memo[w_s][b_s] > 0) return sum+memo[w_s][b_s];
            int min_val = INT_MAX;
            for (int i = 0; i < bikes.size(); i++) {
                if (visited[i]) continue;
                visited[i] = true;
                int dis = abs(workers[w][0] - bikes[i][0]) + 
                    abs(workers[w][1]-bikes[i][1]);
                int next_w_s = w_s | 1<<w;
                int next_b_s = b_s | 1<<i;
                int ret = DFS(workers, bikes, w+1, dis, next_w_s, next_b_s, visited, ans);
                min_val = min(min_val, ret);
                visited[i] = false;
            }
            memo[w_s][b_s] = min_val;
            return sum+min_val;
        }
    int assignBikes(vector<vector<int>>& workers, vector<vector<int>>& bikes) {
        vector<bool> visited(bikes.size(), false);
        int ans = DFS(workers, bikes, 0, 0, 0, 0, visited, ans);
        return ans;
    }
};

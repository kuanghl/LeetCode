### [1136. Parallel Courses](https://leetcode.com/problems/parallel-courses/)

You are given an integer `n`, which indicates that there are `n` courses labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given an array `relations` where `relations[i] = [prevCoursei, nextCoursei]`, representing a prerequisite relationship between course `prevCoursei` and course `nextCoursei`: course `prevCoursei` has to be taken before course `nextCoursei`.

In one semester, you can take **any number** of courses as long as you have taken all the prerequisites in the **previous** semester for the courses you are taking.

Return *the **minimum** number of semesters needed to take all courses*. If there is no way to take all the courses, return `-1`.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/24/course1graph.jpg)

```
Input: n = 3, relations = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The figure above represents the given graph.
In the first semester, you can take courses 1 and 2.
In the second semester, you can take course 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/24/course2graph.jpg)

```
Input: n = 3, relations = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: No course can be studied because they are prerequisites of each other.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `1 <= relations.length <= 5000`
- `relations[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= prevCoursei, nextCoursei <= n`
- `prevCoursei != nextCoursei`
- All the pairs `[prevCoursei, nextCoursei]` are **unique**.

#### Solution

Easy BFS.

#### Code

1. CPP version

```c++

```

2. Python version

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumSemesters(self, n: int, relations: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m = defaultdict(list)
        indegree = defaultdict(int)
        for relation in relations:
            m[relation[0]].append(relation[1])
            indegree[relation[1]] += 1
        q = deque()
        cnt = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if i+1 not in indegree:
                q.append(i+1)
                cnt += 1
        res = 0
        while q:
            size = len(q)
            res += 1
            for _ in range(size):
                cur = q.popleft()
                for nx in m[cur]:
                    indegree[nx] -= 1
                    if indegree[nx] == 0:
                        q.append(nx)
                        cnt += 1
        if cnt != n:
            return -1
        return res

```

### [539. Minimum Time Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-difference/)

Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in **"HH:MM"** format, return *the minimum **minutes** difference between any two time-points in the list*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: timePoints = ["23:59","00:00"]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: timePoints = ["00:00","23:59","00:00"]
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= timePoints.length <= 2 * 104`
- `timePoints[i]` is in the format **"HH:MM"**.

#### Solution

When calculating the difference , we should choose the minimum one, either the time difference or the max time (24*60) minus the time difference.

Time complexity: O(N)

Space complexity: O(N)

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findMinDifference(vector<string>& timePoints) {
        map<int, int> records;
        for (auto& t : timePoints) {
            int hour = stoi(t.substr(0, 2));
            int minute = stoi(t.substr(3));
            int time = hour*60 + minute;
            records[time]++;
            if (records[time] > 1) return 0;
        }
        int max_time = 24*60;
        int res = INT_MAX;
        for (auto it = std::next(records.begin()); it != records.end(); it++) {
            res = min(res, it->first-std::prev(it)->first);
            res = min(res, max_time-(it->first-std::prev(it)->first));
        }
        res = min(res, abs(records.begin()->first-std::prev(records.end())->first));
        res = min(res, max_time-abs(records.begin()->first-std::prev(records.end())->first));
        return res;

    }
};
```
